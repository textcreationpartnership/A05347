            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

But for all this, They perſiſt in their errors, grow more reſolute in their oppoſition, and more dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent to draw diſciples after them,
<note place="margin">Revel. 12.12.</note> like unto him of whom it was ſaid: <hi>He is come downe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you having great wrath, becauſe hee
<pb facs="tcp:14382:4"/>knoweth that he hath but a ſhort time.</hi> So that it may be ſaid of them, as the Prophet of the hard hearted <hi>Iewes,
<note place="margin">Ierem. 5.3.</note> Lord thou haſt ſtricken them, but they have not ſorrowed, thou haſt conſumed them, but they have refuſed to receive correction, they have made their faces harder then a ſtone, and have refuſed to returne.</hi> And this is no new thing for haere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tickes to bee confirmed in their errors by their ſufferings; It was obſerved in ancient time, that not only <hi>Chriſtianitas,</hi> but even <hi>haereſis mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tibus creſcit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And ſurely I have many times wondered how thoſe men who are none of the learnedest, ſhould be able to draw ſuch a faction after them, and bewitch the minds of the people: for every one of theſe <hi>Presbyteriall Dictators</hi> is more eſteemed then the whole <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> they take upon them to teach their mother to give ſuck, the people have plucked out their owne eyes, and given to their teachers, being now able to ſee nothing but through their spectacles, unto whom they doe aſcribe more then <hi>Papall Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility.</hi> But I find that it hath beene ſo in former times, that in a faction neither the learnedeſt
<pb facs="tcp:14382:4"/>men, nor the beſt, but the moſt factious are regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. <hi>Primianus</hi> and <hi>Maximianus</hi> were the heads of the two factions of the <hi>Donatiſts,</hi> and ſayeth <hi>S. Auguſtin:</hi> It was well for them that faction fell out, elſe <hi>Primianus</hi> might have beene <hi>Poſtremianus,</hi> and <hi>Maximianus, Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimianus:</hi> But now in ſchiſme either of them was a jolly fellow, and the head of a party: So faction gaines theſe men more eſteeme, then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe they could either have, or deſerve in Gods <hi>Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And beſides their forwardneſſe to lead a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, I have obſerved diverſe other meanes wherby they have wonne the affection of the people unto a generall liking of their cauſe; <hi>I.</hi> A great ſhew of holyneſſe, like the <hi>Encratites</hi> of old, who termed all other Chriſtians that lived not in like auſterity <hi>Pſychicos,</hi> that is, carnall: And yet even in this they come farre ſhort of that mortification, which was either in <hi>Pelagius</hi> of old, or is at this day in the <hi>Socinians,</hi> whom I may juſtly terme <hi>ſentinam haereticorum,</hi> the worſt of haeretickes. <hi>II.</hi> Their diligence in prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, which yet in them is, rather the labour of the lungs, then of the brain, and (I thanke <hi>God</hi>)
<pb facs="tcp:14382:5"/>many of the conformable Clergie, are as paine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full as they. <hi>III.</hi> To taxe the faults of men in chiefe place, and the preſent government, which the multitude (being ever prone to innovation, and diſlike of the preſent Lawes) are apt to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove, as <hi>Nazianzen</hi> obſerved in his time, <hi>he is thought the holieſt man that can find moſt faults, and the greateſt zelot for the trueth, who is pleaſed with nothing, but what proceeds from his owne deviſing.</hi> Are not theſe they whom <hi>S.

<pb facs="tcp:14382:6"/>mainetayners of falſe doctrine, and ſuch as ſeeke to draw us backe agayne unto Popery: They tell the people of their owne victories in diſputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and conferences, how they have put others to ſilence with the ſtrength of their arguments, when indeed they have not ſpoken one wiſe word: They boast of the inward teſtimony of <hi>Gods</hi> ſpirit aſſuring their conſciences of the trueth of their doctrine.

Now to ſearch a litle into the cauſe of this: Beſides the weakeneſſe of their Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to diſcerne betweene truth and error, and the naturall inclination which is in women to pitty; two things especially make them in love with that religion, one, It is naturall unto the daughters of <hi>Eve</hi> to deſire knowledge, and thoſe men puff them up with an opinion of ſcience, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abling them to prattle of matters of divinity, which they and their teachers underſtand much alike: Inſomuch that albeit <hi>S.

            <p n="1">I. <note place="margin">Sect. 3.</note> Chriſt ſpeakes unto his Diſciples, as may appeare by the whole diſcourſe from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Chapter, but he ſpeakes not unto them as they are Apoſtles, and chiefe Paſtors in his
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:14382:10" rendition="simple:additions"/>Church, but ſimplie as they are Diſciples, that is, Chriſtians; for all the followers of Chriſt were called Diſciples, <hi>Ioh.</hi> VI. 66. The not diſtingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing of theſe two, what was given in charge to the Apoſtles, as they were Apoſtles, and chiefe Paſtors; and what as they were Chriſtians, hath occaſioned many miſpriſions. I will inſtance on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in two particulars. Our Saviour in the cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bration of the Sacrament of the Supper, ſayth to his Diſciples, <hi>Drinke yee all of this:</hi> The Papiſts underſtand this to bee ſpoken to them, as they were Apoſtles, and Miniſters of the Church, and ſo deny that the people have any right to the Cup. whereas it is evident, that in that firſt Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, they did beare the perſon of Communicants, and ſo that benefit belongs to all Chriſtians. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine Chriſt ſayth unto them,
<note place="margin">Matth. 20.25. Mar. 10.42. Luk. 22.24.</note> 
               <hi>The Kings of the Gentiles exerciſe dominion over them — but it ſhall not be ſo amongst you.</hi> Our new maſters, who ſeeke to pull downe the Orders of our Church, take this as ſpoken onely unto Miniſters, and from thence condemne all Superioritie and Iuriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Biſhops: whereas it is evident, that this precept doth alike concerne all Chriſtians. For 1. the occaſion of that prohibition, was the am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition of the ſonnes of <hi>Zebedee,</hi> who dreaming of a temporall kingdome that Chriſt ſhould have in this world, deſired to ſit, one on his right hand, the other on his left; that is, to be the greateſt in that kingdome: They did not deſire Iuriſdiction over Miniſters onely, and place above Apoſtles,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:14382:11"/>but alſo above all Chriſtians; And they concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved hope to obtayne it, not out of any priviledge they had by their Apoſtleſhip, but out of a relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on they had to Chriſt according to the fleſh, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his kinſmen. Therefore this prohibition is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, not to the Apoſtles onely, but to all Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans. II. Chriſt in the XXII. Chap. of <hi>S. Luke,</hi> immediatly before theſe wordes, and preſently after, uſing this word <hi>[you]</hi> and ſpeaking to his Diſciples, and none but them, ſpeakes unto them, as repreſenting not onely Miniſters, but all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians. As verſ. 19. <hi>This is my Body which is given for you,</hi> verſ. 20. <hi>This Cup is the New Teſtament in my Blood which is ſhed for you,</hi> verſ. 29. <hi>I appoint un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you a Kingdome.</hi> In theſe places (I hope) by <hi>[you]</hi> yee will underſtand all true Chriſtians, elſe none but Miniſters have intereſt in Chriſt's Blood, and right unto his Kingdome. And then, why not alſo in the words interjected, verſ. 25. <hi>It ſhall not be ſo among you,</hi> by <hi>[you]</hi> ſhould we un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand all Chriſtians. III. Compare that place with <hi>Matth. XXIII. 8.</hi> which place is alledged, to the ſame purpoſe as the former, againſt titles of honour in the Church, <hi>But bee not yee called Rabbi.</hi> Our Saviour ſpeakes to all Chriſtians, as is evident, verſ. 1. <hi>Then ſpake Ieſus to the multitude, and to his diſciples.</hi> So doth hee alſo in the other place, which is alleaged againſt ruling. IV. It cannot be denyed, but that the Apoſtles did (du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring their life) exerciſe Iuriſdiction over all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Eccleſiaſticall perſons. So did their ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:14382:11"/>who are ſtiled Rulers: Therefore ruling is not forbidden the Apoſtles. yea, our Saviour in the ſame place intimates, that among them, ſome ſhould bee greater than others, ſaying, <hi>Let the greatest among you, bee as the leaſt, and the chiefest as hee that ſerveth.</hi> Finally, the oppoſition between Gentiles and <hi>you,</hi> doth evidently prove, that that precept is given to all Chriſtians. <hi>The Kings of the Gentiles exerciſe dominion over them — but it ſhall not be ſo amongst you.</hi> If his intent had been to forbid ruling in Miniſters onely, he would not have oppoſed them to the Gentiles, but to tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall men in Chriſtian Common-wealthes, or rather to the Prieſts under the Law, ſaying: <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Prieſts of Iſrael ſome rule over other: but it ſhall not bee ſo among you.</hi> But to ſay, it is thus with the Gentiles, it ſhall not be ſo with you Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, is no good oppoſition. And, it is thus with the Gentiles, it ſhall not bee ſo with you Chriſtians, is a full and a fit <hi>antitheſis,</hi> often uſed in Scripture. <hi>Matth. VI. 7. But when yee pray, uſe not vaine repetitions, as the Gentiles doe. Matth. VI. 31. Take no thought, for after all thoſe things ſeeke the Gentiles. I. Theſſ. IV. 5. Not in the luſt of concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcence, as doe the Gentiles.</hi> Still Gentiles oppoſed to Chriſtians, no-where to Miniſters. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in that place nothing is forbidden to Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, but what is unlawfull to all Chriſtians. Not ſuperioritie, authoritie, dominion, Lordſhip, but the ambitious affectation of the ſame, and the ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannicall uſage thereof. So that (my maſters)
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:14382:12"/>If you will make uſe of that Text againſt our au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, you muſt turne plaine Anabaptiſts, and condemne not only Eccleſiaſticall authoritie, but Civill alſo: for Chriſt ſpeakes there to his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, not as Apoſtles, but as Chriſtians, and ſo hee doth in my Text, <hi>If thy brother treſpaſſe against thee;</hi> for the dutie here required, is not proper to Miniſters, but ſuch as concernes all Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, to beare offences patiently, to deſire the ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of our brother, and to that end to admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh him privately, or (if need be) to deferre the matter to the Church. And therefore it is to bee obſerved, how in the next words, ſpeaking of a power proper to the Apoſtles, and their ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors, he changeth the number, to ſhew the change of the perſon, though hee bee ſtill ſpeaking to his Diſciples. For while he ſpeaketh of thoſe duties, which concerne all Chriſtians, he uſeth the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular number, <hi>if hee treſpaſſe againſt thee;</hi> and, <hi>if he will not heare thee,</hi> even <hi>thee,</hi> whoſoever thou bee, that art my diſciple.

            <p>In the next place,
<label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">sect. </seg>4</label> wee are to ſee, of whom hee ſpeakes: of a brother, <hi>If thy brother treſpaſſe,</hi> one that profeſſeth Chriſt; for this courſe which our Saviour preſcribeth to admoniſh our brother, &amp; if need bee to convent him before the Church, is
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:14382:12"/>not to bee taken with thoſe who are altogether without the pale of the Church, as the Apoſtle ſheweth 1. <hi>Cor. V. 9. I wrote unto you not to companie with fornicators, yet not altogether with the fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of this world — for then must yee needs goe out of the world — If any man that is called a brother be a fornicator — with ſuch an one cate not. For what have I to doe, to judge them alſo that are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the third place,
<label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">sect. </seg>5</label> wee are to enquire of what ſinnes he ſpeakes: Certainely, he meanes princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally and properly, private injuries, whereby thy brother hath wounded thee, either in thy body, or eſtate, or reputation. <hi>If hee ſinne against thee.</hi> And ſo <hi>Peter understood it,</hi> verſ. 22. where he ſaith, <hi>Maſter, how often ſhall my brother ſinne against me, and I forgive him.</hi> Yet by Analogie wee are to underſtand it of all ſinnes, and the ſame courſe which is here preſcribed, is to bee obſerved with a brother, that ſinnes againſt God onely; that is, wee are to admoniſh him; and if need bee, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent him before the Church. For Chriſt heere exhorts us to charity; that which he will have us principally to ſeeke, is not ſatiſfaction for the wrong done unto us; but as it is called in the Text: <hi>the gayning of our brother,</hi> that is, his Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. If our Saviour had reſpected onely the wrong done to us, he would never commaund us to complaine; for hee compelles no man to ſue for ſatiſfaction when he is wronged: albeit he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits us to uſe lawful meanes to right our ſelves;
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:14382:13"/>Yet hee would bee well pleaſed, if wee would ſit downe by the wrong. I am ſure the Apoſtle who was inſpired by the ſpirit of Chriſt, adviſeth this as the beſt of all. <hi>Why doe ye not rather take wrong? &amp;c. I. Cor. VI. 7.</hi> But here hee commaunds us to convent our brother offending, before the Church, if he will not heare us, and therefore that which hee would have us ayme at principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, is, his ſalvation, which is in danger, if he be not recovered by repentance, not only when he hath wronged us, but alſo when he hath offended God in any ſort. Againe, wee ought to bee ſo zealous of God's glory, that wee ſhould account ſinnes againſt God, to bee againſt our ſelves. God is ſo ſenſible of the injuries done unto us, as if done to himſelfe: <hi>In all their troubles he was troubled,</hi> ſayth the Prophet <hi>Iſay, LXIII. 9.</hi> And God himſelfe, <hi>Zach. II. 8. He that toucheth you, toucheth the apple of mine eye.</hi> When <hi>Saul</hi> did perſecute the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers upon earth, the Head cryed from Heaven: <hi>Saul, Saul, Why perſecuteſt thou me?</hi> In like manner ſhould wee bee ſenſible of the injuries done to God, accounting them as done to our ſelves, as was <hi>David,</hi> who ſayth, <hi>The rebukes of them who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke the Lord, have fallen upon mee.</hi> In a word, as an offence done to thy neighbour, is a ſin againſt God, in regard of the breach of his Commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: So an offence againſt God, is a ſin againſt thy neighbour, in regard he is ſcandalized by thy bad example. Finally, in other places, the like courſe is preſcribed in other offences, beſides
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:14382:13"/>private injuries. <hi>Levit. XIX. 17. Thou ſhalt not hate thy brother — but plainely rebuke him.</hi> Tit. III. ver. 10. <hi>A man that is an hereticke, after the firſt and ſecond admonition, reject.</hi> So that not onely private wrongs are to bee brought before the Church, but other offences alſo, for it is not likely, that Chriſt would have the <hi>Church</hi> to cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure offences againſt our neighbour, and to ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect the ſinnes committed againſt the <hi>first Table.</hi> But Chriſt mentioneth onely private injuries, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe hee is exhorting to Patience, and Charitie. And we are moſt ſenſible of thoſe offences, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we are hurt: he therfore reſtrayneth us, where wee are moſt forward, knowing well, that if wee can be kept from the violent proſecution of thoſe wrongs which are done to our ſelves, wee will be ſlow enough, in taking notice of other ſinnes, committed againſt God, and our neighbour.</p>
            <p>And now, having found out both the perſons,
<label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">sect. </seg>6</label> and the offences ſpoken of: In the next place, let us conſider the rule preſcribed, or the courſe that is to bee taken, <hi>If thy brother ſhall treſpaſse a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thee.</hi> It is a <hi>Recipe,</hi> for curing an offending brother, wherin our Saviour will have us to deale like tender Phyſicians, who firſt uſe to try gentle remedies; and if that will not doe, they miniſter ſtronger pills, that are more offenſive to Nature. So ſhould we doe; for, the Cure here preſcribed, is fourefold. The I. Private admonition, <hi>Tell him his fault betweene thee and him;</hi> that is, <hi>Corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptio Amoris.</hi> II. Reproofe before witneſſes,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:14382:14"/>
               <hi>If hee will not heare thee, take with thee, one, or two more,</hi> that is, <hi>Correptio pudoris.</hi> III. Publicke ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſation, <hi>If he will not heare them, tell it unto the</hi> Church; that is, <hi>Correptio timoris.</hi> IIII. Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, <hi>If hee neglect to heare the Church, let him bee unto thee as an heathen.</hi> &amp; that is, <hi>Correptio tremoris.</hi> The firſt is <hi>mylde,</hi> the ſecond <hi>ſharp,</hi> the third <hi>bitter,</hi> the fourth <hi>deſperate.</hi> The firſt, is but a <hi>prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,</hi> the ſecond a <hi>potion,</hi> the third a <hi>Corraſive,</hi> the fourth <hi>abſciſion,</hi> or cutting off. Now wee muſt not thinke, that all theſe degrees can be obſerved at all occaſions, and as oft as our brother offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth. Sometimes the offence is ſo light, that it is better to paſſe it by, then to take notice of it. Sometimes, though the ſinne be great, yet it is committed ſo privatelie, that it is to no purpoſe for thee to tell it unto the Church; for if he deny it, thou canſt not prove it. Sometimes the offence is ſo notorious, and ſcandalous, that the Church takes notice of it, no private admonition going before,

Albeit it may be lawfull in ſome caſe, to receive the Sacrament ſitting, where there is no conſtitution to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarye yet you who make ſitting neceſſary and eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentiall to the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> cannot be excuſed from the breach of the ſecond <hi>Commaundement,</hi> by will worſhip, wherewith you doe moſt falſly charge

You can never free your ſelves from that condemnation, who place religion in a tablegeſture. That is will-worſhip in the higheſt degree. VII. Neyther is ſitting the onely table geſture, In <hi>Muſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Nor yet would he be ſo obſtinate as you are, to chooſe ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to want meate, then to ſtoope for it. Yea if any of you ſhould receive a morſell of meate or a cup of drinke, from out of the kings owne hand, I thinke you would not plead the priviledge of a
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:14382:40"/>table geſture, but kneele downe to receave it: Behold in the Sacrament the <hi>King of glorie</hi> rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth forth his <hi>Sonne,</hi> as it were, with his <hi>blood a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout his eares,</hi> ſhed for our redemption, and will you ſtand ſo much upon a table geſture, and the priviledge of a gueſt, that you wil rather be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the comfort of the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> then bow your knee to receave it. VIII. As it is the generall cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome of our Countrey to ſit at meate, ſo it is the cuſtome of our <hi>Church</hi> to kneele at the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> neyther ever had the <hi>Catholicke Church,</hi> any ſuch cuſtome, as to receave ſitting. And ſhall not the cuſtome of the <hi>Church,</hi> of all <hi>Churches,</hi> be as much regarded in a <hi>Church-action,</hi> as the cuſtome of the Countrey is in a civill matter. Finally, If there be a neceſſity of ſitting, becauſe it is a table ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture, the priviledge of a feaſt, and the prerogative of gueſts; there muſt be the like neceſſity of other deportments uſed in civill eating, which are as proper to the nature of a feaſt, and the preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of gueſts, as ſitting is: And then why doe yee not receive the <hi>Sacrament</hi> in your dyning roomes? for the <hi>Church</hi> is not a fit place to eate &amp; drinke in: Why doe you not ſalute and welcome one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother before you ſit downe, as the manner is at Civill Feaſts? why doe you not uſe trenchers, napkins, knives, as well as ſtooles? why doe you not eate a full meale, feede heartily, drinke oftner then once, and pledge one another? for all theſe doe belong to a liberall and honourable inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainement, ſuch as your authors ſay muſt bee in
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:14382:41"/>the <hi>Sacrament;</hi> I am ſure it is as farre from honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable intertainement &amp; the prerogative of gueſts, to receive but one bit of <hi>Bread,</hi> and one drop of <hi>Wine,</hi> as it is eyther to ſtand or to kneele. Why doe you not intertaine diſcourſe one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? And eſpecially why doe you not keepe on your hats, as at other Feaſts, that ſo you may bee every man jacke-fellow-like with <hi>Chriſt</hi> in your ſociall <hi>Communions?</hi> I am afraid it will come to this at laſt, by that time your people have learned all the myſteries of your religion:

            <p>Thus I have clearely proved,
<label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">sect. </seg>33</label> that the geſture which <hi>Chriſt</hi> uſed in the inſtitution of this <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> was not ſitting: for either he uſed the ſame geſture in the <hi>Evangelicall Supper,</hi> which he did in the <hi>Legall,</hi> or hee uſed another: if hee continued the ſame geſture, it was not ſitting, but either ſtanding, or rather lying: if he uſed another, you your ſelves know not what it was, and I dare boldly ſay, that it is more likely to have beene ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

There was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver any geſture eſſentiall to any <hi>Sacrament,</hi> either under the <hi>Law,</hi> or under the <hi>Goſpell;</hi> for wee know not what geſture was uſed in <hi>Circumciſion,</hi> and in <hi>Baptiſme;</hi> and it is manifeſt, that the geſture of the <hi>Paſſeover,</hi> was varyed from ſtanding, to lying. I ſay further, there was never example of geſture in any ordinance, or holy ſervice, which bound the <hi>Church</hi> abſolutely, but ſo as it might be chaunged upon occaſion. We have examples in Scripture, of all geſtures uſed in praying, in thankſgiving, in hearing of the Word, in offering of ſacrifice. And I doe here challenge you all, to ſhew me but one example of geſture in any <hi>Sacrament,</hi> or any other

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> ſhould become neceſſary, without any ſpeciall commaund. IV. <hi>God</hi> hath fully expreſſed, what is neceſſary to bee obſerved in any of his Ordinances: But in all the <hi>Booke of God,</hi> there is not one word expreſſing what geſture wee ſhould uſe in the <hi>Sacrament:</hi> all the <hi>Evangeliſts</hi> are ſilent in this matter; ſo is <hi>S. Paul,</hi> though he profeſſe to deliver all things ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary and eſſentiall to the <hi>Sacrament:</hi> And on the contrary it is very probable, that our <hi>Saviour</hi> had no intent to honour us with the geſture of ſitting at the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> for even while hee ſate with his <hi>Diſciples</hi> at the <hi>Paſſeover,</hi> hee ſchooled them for looking for honour in ſitting at the table, <hi>Luk.</hi> XXII. 26. <hi>Let the greatest among you, be as the leaſt; and the chiefeſt, as he that ſerveth; for who is greater, he that ſitteth at table, or he that ſerveth? Is not he that ſitteth at table? and I am among you as he that ſerveth.</hi> Now you doe preſſe us to ſhew expreſſe warrant out of Scripture, for things which we acknowledge to bee in their owne na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture free, and indifferent, and ſo need no particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:14382:43"/>warrant of the Word, they being left to the diſcretion of the <hi>Church;</hi> And yet you preſſe ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting at the <hi>Communion,</hi> upon the conſciences of people, as a thing neceſſary, and are not able to ſhew for it any warrant in the Word, generall or particular. If you ſay, that you have the example of Chriſt and of his Diſciples, that will not ſerve your turne; for you know not what geſture they uſed; and albeit wee were certaine that they had ſate, as you doe, yet that would not binde us to i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation, without ſome other direction; for doubtleſſe, if <hi>Chriſt</hi> had meant, that his geſture in that <hi>Sacrament</hi> ſhould be exemplary unto us, hee would have put upon it ſome marke of immuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie, conſidering that from the beginning of the world, no geſture in any <hi>Sacrament</hi> or ſervice was obligatory unto <hi>God's</hi> people by example. V. If the geſture which <hi>Chriſt</hi> uſed in the miniſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> was ſitting or lying; the ſame was occaſion all from the <hi>Paſſeover,</hi> as were many other circumſtances, which you your ſelves doe not obſerve. Indeed, if <hi>Chriſt</hi> had mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred that <hi>Sacrament,</hi> without the conjunction of another meale, and had purpoſely made choice of ſitting, rather then of kneeling or ſtanding, then there might have been more force in his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, and yet no abſolute neceſſitie of imitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But ſeeing it is manifeſt, that if hee uſed that geſture, it was to conforme himſelfe to the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome of the <hi>Iewes,</hi> as hee did in many other cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies and circumſtances; no reaſonable man
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:14382:43"/>can thinke that geſture to be exemplary to us.</p>

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/>
               <hi>Chriſt</hi> was the ſole miniſter of the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> bleſſing and diſtributing both the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: you commonly have one to aſſiſt you. <hi>Christ</hi> bleſſed the Elements ſeverally,

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="13"/> Finally, <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his <hi>Diſciples</hi> had their heads covered: you as yet have the manners to ſit bare: In all theſe, you ſwarve as much from the example of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as we doe by kneeling: for as theſe were changeable circumſtances, ſo is the geſture changeable, &amp; inferiour to many of them. For they are expreſſely mentioned in <hi>Scripture:</hi> but there is not one word of the geſture. Some of them were circumſtances of choyce, as namely<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
               <hi>Chriſts</hi> bleſſing of the Elements apart: But the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture (if it was ſitting or lying) was only occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onall.

<pb n="71" facs="tcp:14382:44" rendition="simple:additions"/>men are moſt apt for devotion: But you are never able to ſhew, that the geſture (if it was ſitting) was uſed in any <hi>Church.</hi> I might adde many other things wherein you follow not the example of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> becauſe you know it not. Wee know not what forme of Bread <hi>Christ</hi> uſed, what kinde of Wine, what faſhion of Cup, what manner of Tablecloath, what words he uſed, in bleſſing and giving thankes, after what manner hee brake the Bread, and powred out the Wine into the Cup, what quantitie of Bread and Wine they did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, and how long they were about that action. All which are of greater importance, then the geſture, which (as I have ſhewed before) was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver immutable in any Ordinance, but alwayes free. Therefore you ſhall doe well, for ſhame, (if not for conſcience ſake) not to take the holy name of <hi>Christ</hi> in vaine, by pretending his example, for ſitting at the Communion, ſeeing you doe not imitate his example in many other things, more materiall then the geſture.</p>
            <p>In the laſt place,
<label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">sect. </seg>35</label> that if the geſture of <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his <hi>Diſciples,</hi> in the firſt inſtitution, was ſitting, wee ought not to imitate it. For there is great difference betweene the eſtate of the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles</hi> then, and ours now: betweene <hi>Chriſts</hi> eſtate of humiliation, and his eſtate of exaltation: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene his preſence in humility,
<note place="margin">Matth. XX. 28.</note> and his preſence in glory. In his firſt comming he came not to be ſerved, but to ſerve:
<note place="margin">Ioh. XV. 15. Luk. XXII. 27.</note> He made himſelfe familiar with his <hi>Diſciples,</hi> uſed them as his friends &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:14382:45"/>and he himſelfe was amongſt them, as one that ſerveth. And therefore they did never kneele downe to him in their ordinary prayers, nor pray unto <hi>God,</hi> particularly in his name, as he ſayth, <hi>Ioh.</hi> XVI. 24. <hi>Hither to have yee aſked nothing in my name.</hi> It is certain that the <hi>Diſciples</hi> did pray unto <hi>God,</hi> and did pray in the name of a mediator in generall, elſe their prayers could not have been heard: But at that time, they did not make expreſſe mention of him in their prayers, in regard their knowledge of his <hi>Godhead,</hi> and of his Mediator<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, was but obſcure and imperfect, and they then did not thinke, that hee who was daily converſant with them upon earth, was alſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent with the Father making interceſſion for them. Yea at that time <hi>Chriſt</hi> did not deſire, to be worſhipped as <hi>God,</hi> Coeternall, Coeſſentiall and Conſubſtantiall with the Father, for he comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded his <hi>Diſciples</hi> to conceale the glory of his Godhead,

               <note place="margin">Act. <hi>VII.</hi> 59.</note> who before were rude and ignorant, did preach him openly, and pray unto him by name, and that upon their knees. Now, if the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> after his reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, when they were filled with the <hi>Spirit,</hi> did pray unto him kneeling, which they had not uſed to doe before; why may wee not think, that then they alſo received the <hi>Sacrament</hi> kneeling, albeit before they did ſit with him at table, while hee was pleaſed to uſe them as his companions, and when their knowledge was but rude and unper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. Sure I am, it doth not become us now for to
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:14382:46"/>challenge to be ſo familiar with him at his table, as were his <hi>Diſciples</hi> in the dayes of his fleſh. Thus have I clearely proved, both that it is moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his <hi>Diſciples</hi> ſate in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of the <hi>Sacrament;</hi> and alſo that though it were certaine they did ſit, yet the example of their geſture doth not binde us to imitation. But I have forgot my ſelfe to inſiſt ſo long upon this Argument. My purpoſe at firſt was onely, to give an inſtance of your ſitting at the <hi>Communion,</hi> as a Ceremonie uſed by you in the ſervice of <hi>God,</hi> without any ſpeciall warrant: but when I conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, that this is the very <hi>Diana</hi> for which you ſtrive, and the wall of ſeparation between you &amp; the <hi>Church;</hi> I thought fit to inlarge my ſelfe upon this point, to manifeſt unto all thoſe who love the trueth, that ſitting hath no more ground in <hi>Christ's</hi> Inſtitution, then kneeling.</p>
            <p>And now to proceed,
<note place="margin">Sect. 36.</note> I will ſhew you other Ceremonies uſed by you in Gods worſhip, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any ſpeciall warrant. The next to ſitting at the <hi>Communion,</hi> is ſprinkling in <hi>Baptiſme,</hi> for which there is no warrant, but the cuſtome of the preſent <hi>Church:</hi> for the auncient Ceremonie in Baptiſme, was not aſperſion, but immerſion, which Ceremonie was ſanctified by the <hi>Baptiſme</hi> of our <hi>Saviour,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Matth. III. 16. Mark. I. 10.</note> for the <hi>Evangeliſts</hi> ſay, <hi>When he was baptized, he came out of the water,</hi> and therefore he went in into the water. The ſame was uſed by the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> and thereunto the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> alludeth, ſhewing that the mortification of ſinne, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:14382:46"/>of that mortification, and the vivification of the new man, are ſignified by the Ceremonie of <hi>Baptiſme,</hi> for the dipping in <hi>Baptiſme</hi> had three parts, their going down into the water, their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance in the water, and their comming up out of the water. The going downe into the water, figureth the mortification of ſinne by the power of <hi>Christs</hi> death, <hi>for all wee</hi> (ſayeth the Apoſtle) <hi>which have beene baptized into Ieſus Chriſt, have been baptized into his death:</hi> The continuance in the water, noteth the increaſe of that mortification, by the power of <hi>Christs</hi> death and buryall; <hi>We are buryed with him by Baptiſme into his death:</hi> The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming up out of the water, ratifieth our riſing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine unto newneſſe of life; <hi>Like as Christ was rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed from the dead, to the glory of the Father, ſo wee alſo ſhould walke in newneſſe of life,</hi> Rom. VI. 3.4. This Ceremonie was continued in the <hi>Church</hi> for many hundred yeares, and to that purpoſe in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient times, they had places in each Church for dipping, called <hi>Baptiſteria</hi> and <hi>Lotiones:</hi> neither was ſprinkling generally practiſed in the <hi>Church,</hi> till 1300. yeares after Chriſt; when (to uſe your owne words) <hi>Antichriſt</hi> was in his full height. Now can you ſhew me any reaſon, why you may leave a Ceremonie which was certainly uſed by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> by his <hi>Apostles,</hi> and the whole auncient <hi>Church,</hi> and was of ſingular uſe for fignification; and in ſtead of it, take another not ſo ſignificant, brought into the <hi>Church</hi> by <hi>Antichriſt?</hi> And that yet it ſhall not bee lawfull for the whole <hi>Church,</hi>
               <pb n="76" facs="tcp:14382:47"/>to lay downe another Ceremonie, (to wit, ſitting at the <hi>Communion</hi>) whereof there is no certainty nor likely hood, that ever it was uſed by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> or his <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> or any <hi>Church</hi> in the world; and in place of it, to uſe another, which is a great deale more decent and comely. Thirdly, you uſe to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyne pennance, &amp; to receive penitents in a white ſheet: and I am ſure, that if a Surplice in Gods Service, be a Ceremonie, ſo is a white ſheet in pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blick pennance and abſolution, and there is no more warrant for the one, then for the other. Fourthly, you uſe a Ceremonie in Marriage, by joyning of hands, and pronouncing of words, which are not commaunded. Fiftly, I could tell you, that the time was in the dayes of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſbyterie, when that <hi>Church,</hi> whoſe orders you ſo much approve, did uſe a Ceremonie in Ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and a very ſtrange one: It was not impoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of hands, but ſhaking them by the hand, to bid them welcome into their Societie, becauſe forſooth, they were loath in any thing, to have a conformitie with the auncient <hi>Apoſtolick Church.</hi> Sixtly, you profeſſe to honour the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neva,</hi> as a fit patterne unto all other <hi>Churches,</hi> and yet they uſe the Ceremonie of godfathers in <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſme,</hi> and wafer Cakes in the <hi>Communion,</hi> againſt which one Ceremonie, I could ſay more, then can be ſaid againſt all the Ceremonies of our <hi>Church.</hi> Finally, the lifting up of the eyes to Heaven, the ſpreading out of the hands, the knocking of the breaſt, ſighing and groaning in Gods ſervice, are
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:14382:47"/>Ceremonies, uſed by none ſo much, as by your ſelves; And yet I confeſſe, that if they proceed from a ſincere heart, they are lawfull expreſſions of devotion. By this time you doe all ſee, that whereas you deny Ceremonies in Gods worſhip, which are not commaunded, you are evidently convinced by your owne practiſe.</p>
            <p>I thinke that I have ſaid enough,
<note place="margin">Sect. 37.</note> to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw that ground which you have laid, that no Ceremonies ought to bee uſed in Gods ſervice without a ſpeciall warrant from the word. Now for the concluſion of this poynt, I will appeale unto the confeſſions of the reformed <hi>Churches,</hi> and the ſuffrages of divines. You profeſſe to approve the <hi>Articles</hi> of the <hi>Church of England,</hi> as contay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning nothing but trueth, (though not ſo manie particulars, as you account to be matters of faith) and thoſe Articles doe aſcribe ſuch a power to the <hi>Church</hi> to ordaine Ceremonies, as you may ſee in the <hi>XX.</hi> Article: <hi>The Church hath power to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree rites or Ceremonies.</hi> and againe in the XXXIIII.

I. That it is not only lawfull, but expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent and requiſite, to uſe Ceremonies in <hi>Gods</hi> wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:14382:48"/>II. That thoſe Ceremonies ſhould be ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficant. III. That it is not neceſſary that the ſame Ceremonies bee obſerved in all <hi>Churches,</hi> at all times. IV. That we are not bound to obſerve all thoſe Ceremonies, which were uſed by the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles,</hi> and the <hi>Primitive Church.</hi> V. That we may retain ſome Ceremonies uſed by the <hi>Iewes,</hi> name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ceremonies of order, not of prefiguration. VI. That we may uſe ſome Ceremonies uſed by the Pagans. VII. That wee may retaine ſome Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of the Papiſts. VIII. That the governors of the <hi>Church</hi> have power to make choice of Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, to change and abrogate ſome, and to ordayne others, as they ſhall ſee occaſion. Final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, That wee are bound to obſerve all Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, which are injoyned by lawfull authoritie, provided that they bee qualified with theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions following.
<note place="margin">Inſtit. lib. <hi>IV.</hi> c. 10. §. 14.</note> M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Calvin</hi> requireth three conditions: That they have, <hi>In numero paucitatem, in obſervatione facilitatem; in ſignificatione dignita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem.</hi> I. For number they ſhould be few; for when the <hi>Church</hi> is peſtered with the multitude of them, it makes the eſtate of <hi>Chriſtians</hi> to be more intollerable, then the condition of the <hi>Iewes,</hi> as it is in the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> whoſe miſſalls are lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger then the booke of <hi>Leviticus,</hi> whereof <hi>Gerſon, Polydore Virgill,</hi> and others did complaine in their time. II. They ſhould bee eaſie for obſervation. III. For ſignification they ſhould be grave, decent and comely; not fooliſh and ridiculous, as are the apiſh geſticulations in the <hi>Maſſe,</hi> and many other
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:14382:48"/>Ceremonies uſed in that <hi>Church,</hi> as their manifold croſſings, kiſſings, kneelings, whiſperings, waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, anointings, ſpittings, blowings, breathings, and a number of the like. Unto theſe three con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, I will adde two more. I. Ceremonies muſt not be injoyned, as things in themſelves ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely neceſſary, and wherein <hi>Gods</hi> worſhip doth conſiſt. II. We muſt not aſcribe unto them ſpirituall effects, as the <hi>Papists</hi> doe, who ſay that their croſſing, and ſprinkling of holy water, are effectuall to purge away veniall ſinnes, drive a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way <hi>divells,</hi> and ſanctifie the parties. Now the Ceremonies injoyned by our Church, have all theſe conditions. For number, they are few, as ever was in any <hi>Church;</hi> for obſervation, eaſie; for ſignification, worthy; for quality, grave, decent and comely; for antiquity, reverend; The worſhip of <hi>God</hi> is not placed in them, neither are they preſſed upon the conſciences of people, as things in themſelves neceſſary, like the Commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of <hi>God:</hi> we aſcribe no merit, remiſſion of ſinnes, nor other ſpirituall effects unto them. Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally they are purged from the droſſe of all <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh</hi> ſuperſtition. And therefore you are bound in conſcience to obſerve them, they being injoyned by lawfull authority.</p>
            <p>And now I am come to the laſt thing wherein the power of the <hi>Church</hi> is to bee conſidered,
<note place="margin">Sect. 38.</note> and that is for <hi>correction.</hi> The Church hath authority to cenſure her diſobedient children, whether they be <hi>Heretickes</hi> or <hi>Schiſmatickes,</hi> or inordinate

            <p>This was the only cauſe which moved mee to heare their objections.

<pb n="114" facs="tcp:14382:66"/>few doubtes, they were ready to yeeld that obedience which is required: And both to conforme themſelves unto the preſent governement, &amp; to draw their people unto conformity alſo.

Beſides the weakeneſſe of their underſtanding is ſuch, that they were not capable, either of Arguments or anſwers, but tranſported with the opponents ſighes, groanes, lifting up of his eyes, &amp; ſpreading out of his hands; being the beſt Arguments which ever theſe zelots learned in the Schooles: And indeed of no ſmall waight with the common people; As the Orator well knew, when being in a certaine de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence prevented of his uſuall and lamentable concluſion, by the teares, and more lamentable concluſion of <hi>Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senſius,</hi> he cryed out as one halfe undone, <hi>Surripuiſti mihi ornamenta Orationis meae.</hi> Is it then any wonder that my conference which was only begun, and ſo rather inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, then acted, had not the deſired ſucceſſe? yet I dare ſay that cenſure which <hi>Eraſmus</hi> paſt upon that confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betwixt <hi>S.

            <p>Beſides thoſe exceptions, all that was objected for orders ſake, I ſhall reduce unto three heads: for in the Libell there is neither method nor ſenſe.</p>
            <p>Firſt, he deſired a warrant from Scripture, to juſtifie our Ceremonies; whereunto my anſwer was: That if they meant a particular and expreſſe commaundement for every Ceremony and <hi>Church</hi>-conſtitution, I had ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently proved in my Sermon, that it could not be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, neither are they themſelves able to produce ſuch a warrant, for ſuch orders as they themſelves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyne and practiſe in their owne Congregations: But if they meant a generall warrant, our <hi>Church</hi> hath as much as they, or any other <hi>Church</hi> yet ever had for their conſtitutions: Even that warrant of the Apoſtle, <hi>Let all things be done decently, and in order. 1.

<note place="margin">Calvin in lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum.</note> by which all other Canons muſt be ſquared, the true Touch-ſtone to try Ceremonies, and the Ballance wherein all <hi>Church</hi>-Orders ſhould bee weighed. And whereas ſome Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies ſeeme decent unto ſome, which unto others, ſeeme otherwiſe; Thoſe whom God hath made Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours of his <hi>Church,</hi> (and not any private man) are to judge of their decencie.

            <p>Now, what ſayth the Libeller to this? he ſtruggles like a fiſh on the hooke, and uttereth ſuch pittiful ſtuffe, that I am aſhamed to relate it. Hee tells us, that the meaning of the Apoſtles words, is; <hi>Let all things orday<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by God, be done decentlie and in order;</hi> Bee it ſo: The Sacrament is ordayned by <hi>God,</hi> and therefore to be received decently: Now, I have fully proved in my Sermon, that <hi>God</hi> hath not in Scripture, either by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept or by example determined, what particular geſture ſhould bee uſed in the Sacrament: And therefore the ſame is left to bee appointed at the diſcretion of the <hi>Church:</hi> The <hi>Church</hi> hath appointed kneeling, which is a decent geſture, as afterwards I ſhall ſhew. I have alſo declared, that Kneeling is no humane invention, but a naturall geſture, and ſo ordayned by <hi>God,</hi> which hath been, and may bee applyed to every part of <hi>Gods</hi> wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. He further ſayes, <hi>That rule must abide the tryall of other rules of Gods word;</hi> This is ſtrange Divinitie: Will he queſtion a rule of <hi>Gods Word,</hi> call it to the barre, and try it by a ſurie of its fellowes? But I thinke his
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:14382:68"/>intent was, (if hee could have written ſenſe,) to ſay, that Kneeling at the Communion, muſt abide the tryall of other rules: And ſo it ſhall; even of that rule which he hath mentioned, <hi>Abſtaine from all appearance of evill.</hi> As I ſhall ſhew in the proper place. In the meane time I tell him, that their ſitting at the Communion will not abide the tryall of any of the rules of <hi>Gods word.</hi> I have proved in my Sermon, that it is an undecent and unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verent behaviour in <hi>Gods</hi> worſhip, that it was never commanded, &amp; ſeldome or never practiſed in any act of <hi>Gods</hi> ſervice, but onely upon occaſion: It carryes an appearance of evill, a ſhew of profaneneſſe, irreverence, pride, &amp; preſumption: It is flat contrary unto that rule of the Apoſtle;

I ſhewed that there was a great difference between their caſe and ours in two particulars; firſt, The things where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>about they did differ, (namely eating or not eating of things ſacrificed unto Idolls) were meerely indifferent, not only in their owne nature, but even for uſe; it being
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:14382:68"/>free and arbitrary unto them to eate or not to eate, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch as there was no law either to command, or to forbid the uſe of theſe meates; And therefore the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving Romanes, and the Corinthians not onely might, but alſo ought, ſometimes to abſtaine from ſuch meates, for the avoyding of ſcandall. But it is not ſo with our Ceremonies, albeit they be indifferent in their owne na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as neither being particularly commanded, nor for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden in <hi>Scripture:</hi> yet they are not now indifferent unto us, for the uſe, nor left unto our choyce, the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of them being injoyned by lawfull authoritie, (and that the Magiſtrate hath power to make Lawes in things indifferent none will deny but an Anabaptiſt) And therefore now, though never ſo many ſhould bee offended at our Ceremonies, yet we can not forbeare to uſe them without a greater ſcandall in open diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to lawfull authority. Before that Apoſtolicall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, <hi>Act.</hi> XV. It was lawfull for a man either to eate, or not to eate things ſacrificed unto Idolls, as hee found in his conſcience moſt expedient for aedification, there being no law divine, or humane, to rule his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, but only the Iudgement of his owne minde and the generall law of charitie: But after that conſtitution was made, It was not lawfull for him to eate, though in the preſence of converted Gentiles, who would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps bee offended at his forbearance; becauſe now though the matter bee indifferent in its owne nature yet it was not free and arbitrary for uſe, at leſt to thoſe <hi>Churches,</hi> for whom the conſtitution was made, of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch, Syria,</hi> and <hi>Cilicia:</hi> for it ſeemes that the eating of things ſacrificed to Idolls, was in ſome ſort permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Corinth,</hi> if no man did challenge it. I. <hi>Cor.</hi> X. 27. <hi>Whatſoever is ſet before you eate, asking no que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion for conſcience ſake.</hi> A ſecond difference I obſerved betweene their caſe and ours, that thoſe whom the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle will not have us to offend by the uſe of our Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:14382:69"/>liberty, in things indifferent, were weake brethren, as ſhall appeare in all the places alleadged by the Diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, <hi>Rom.</hi> XIV. 1. <hi>Him that is weake in the faith receive unto you,</hi> v. 2. <hi>One believeth that he may eate of all things; And another which is weake eateth herbes.</hi> Whereupon followes immediatly, <hi>Let not him that eateth, despiſe him that eateth not.</hi> Chap.

They were weake as being newly converted unto the faith, &amp; as yet neither having meanes, nor leiſure, to be fully in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed in their Chriſtian libertie, and therefore much was to be yeilded unto them, leſt comming newly from Iudaiſme, where they had learned to be zealous of the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> if they ſhould ſee Chriſtians not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve that Law, they might be offended at the Chriſtian Religion. And withall it is to be praeſumed, that thoſe to whom the Apoſtle graunts ſuch Indulgence, were willing to be inſtructed in the right way. But thoſe who take offence at our Ceremonies, are not now to be eſteemed weake: They thinke themſelves the onely il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luminates, even the very <hi>Gnostiques</hi> of this age, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of whom, all others, who are not of their facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on are very <hi>Ignaroes,</hi> whoſe minds the god of the world hath ſo blinded, that they are deſtitute of heavenly knowledge. Beſides, they have had a large time allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them, to informe their conſciences, and all meanes have been uſed to give them ſatisfaction. <hi>But a foole deſpiſeth his fathers Inſtruction. Prov.</hi> XV. 5. And why? <hi>The way of a foole is right in his owne eyes. Prov.</hi> XII. 15. So that thoſe brethren, whom the Apoſtle would not have others to offend, in the uſe of their Chriſtian liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in things indifferent, were only weake; Ours are wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full; They timorous, Ours obſtinate; Their offence pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded from ſimple ignorance, ariſing from the want of
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:14382:69"/>time, and meanes of Inſtruction; But the offence which our men take at the Ceremonies, proceedes from affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted error, from pride, prejudice, ſingularity, and the ſpirit of malice and contention. And therefore I dare ſay, that albeit his Majeſty, and all that are in authority over us, would diſpenſe with the preſent Lawes, and leave it to our owne choyce, whether to uſe, or not to uſe the Ceremonies, for feare of giving them offence: Yet were we bound in conſcience not to yeeld unto them in one jot by our forbearance, in regard that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we ſhould but bolſter them in their error, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme them in their obſtinacy and oppoſition againſt the <hi>Church.</hi> I am ſure this was the practice of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles; At firſt they yeelded much to the weakneſſe of Iewiſh Converts, doing and forbearing many things, to avoyd their offence: But when they did pertinaciouſly perſiſt in their error, calling our Chriſtian liberty in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, the Apoſtles reſolutely maintayned it, not regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding their offence at all. So S. <hi>Paul</hi> who circumciſed <hi>Timothie,</hi> to avoyd the offence of the weake Iewes, would not circumciſe <hi>Titus,</hi> to pleaſe others who were perverſe deſpiſers of our libertie; And he who did pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie himſelfe to gaine a good opinion of the weake Iewes who were zealous of the Law;

                  </gap>5.</note> yet when certain falſe brethren crept in privily to ſpy our liberty, <hi>he gave not place unto them by ſubjection for an houre.</hi> And whenas S. <hi>Peter</hi> for feare of offending the Iewes at <hi>Antioch,</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bare to eate with the Gentiles, he reproved him for it to his face, interpreting that fact of his to be an effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all ſeducement, albeit he did not preach Iudaiſme, <hi>Why compelleſt thou the Gentiles to Iudaize?</hi> ver. 14. As hee would not yeeld to any thing to diſpleaſe thoſe who were wilfull deſpiſers of our liberty, no more ſhould we to pleaſe thoſe men, who are reſolved never to be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied. I am ſure the tendereſt hearted man amongſt them, will not forbeare the eating of a fat Capon upon
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:14382:70"/>Good-Friday, for feare of offending a Papiſt. And why ſhould we forbeare either Surplis, Croſſe, or Kneeling, becauſe they are offended at it.</p>
            <p>In theſe two particulars I ſhewed in the Court, the difference between the things whereof the Apoſtle ſpeaketh, and our Ceremonies, ſo plainly, that it was thought ſufficient to ſatisfie any, but thoſe in whom af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection &amp; partiality have put out the eye of reaſon. And upon theſe two caſes I dare now venture the cauſe. firſt, that we are no-where commanded to forbeare the uſe of a thing indifferent, even where we are left to our owne choyce, for feare of offending the willfull deſpiſers of our libertie; but only to avoyd the offence of weak bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, who are willing to learne the right way, &amp; have not had leyſure and meanes to be informed. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that if the Magiſtrate interpoſe his authoritie, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding the uſe of a thing in it ſelfe indifferent; wee are not to forbeare the doing of it, for feare of offending any whatſoever they be, whether wilfull, or only weak. And that it is ſo, ſhal appeare unto him who reades theſe two Chapters, whereunto the Diſputer did appeale, &amp; ſtudies not the ſyllables, but the ſenſe of them. And to make this ſame yet more manifeſt, I will recommend unto the Reader that is deſirous of ſatisfaction, theſe conſiderations following. I. When the Apoſtle char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth us to avoyd the offence of our weake brother, he gives this reaſon, that we ſhould not pleaſe ourſelves, but our <hi>neighbour to aedification, Rom. XV.</hi> 1.2. Whereby it is evident, that he ſpeakes only of theſe things which are not commanded, but left to our own liberty to doe or not to doe, in which caſe he wil have us to pleaſe our neighbour, if he be a weake brother, rather then our ſelves: But if the Magiſtrate have interpoſed his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement in a thing indifferent, then as we can not forbeare it to pleaſe our neighbour, if he be a weake brother; ſo wee doe it not to pleaſe our
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:14382:70"/>ſelves, but to pleaſe him, whom <hi>God</hi> hath co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded us to obey, not only for wrath, but for conſcience ſake. II. A thing in it ſelfe indifferent, being injoyned by law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full authority, becommeth neceſſary unto us for the uſe; So the Apoſtles ſpeaking of things in themſelves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different, as abſtinence from meates offered to Idols &amp;c. When once they had made a conſtitution touching them, call them <hi>Neceſſarie things Act.</hi> XV. 28. And the Apoſtle ſayes <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>.
<note place="margin">Rom. XIII. 5.</note> It is neceſſary that you bee ſubject. And ſurely there is nothing wherein wee can ſhew our obedience unto the Magiſtrates au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, but only in things indifferent, which <hi>God</hi> hath left in our power: for, thoſe things which <hi>God</hi> hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, wee muſt doe, whether the Magiſtrate com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand them or no, yea albeit hee ſhould forbid them: And thoſe things which <hi>God</hi> hath forbidden, wee muſt not doe, whether the Magiſtrate forbid them or no, yea albeit hee ſhould command them: ſo that there is no ſcope left, either unto the Magiſtrate to command, or unto us to obey, but only in things indifferent. III. If wee ſhould not obey the Magiſtrate in a thing indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, when ſome men take offence at it; then we ſhall never obey him at all, there ſhall be no order, no conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution; for there can be no publicke action, order, or conſtitution, which ſome men will not diſlike. IV. Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the Magiſtrate is a greater duty then the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of a private perſon, and conſequently the evill of diſobedience, greater then the evill of ſcandall. V. If our obedience to the Magiſtrate in a thing indifferent, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend any, the evill is not in us, but in him who is ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalized: for as <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſaith, <hi>Res bona neminem offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, niſi malam mentem.</hi> It is <hi>ſcandalum acceptum,</hi> not <hi>da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,</hi> he ought not to be offended, being bound to obey the Magiſtrate as well as we: now were it not a ſtrange, if I ſhould forbeare to doe my duty, becauſe another man is reſolved not to doe his. VI. As it is a ſinne to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obey
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:14382:71"/>lawfull authority, and no ſinne in us, if another bee offended at our obedience: ſo there is farre greater dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, both to our ſelves and to all the whole <hi>Church,</hi> in diſobedience, then can be in the offence of a few bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren. Laſtly, If wee refuſe thoſe things that are injoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, we cannot avoyd diſobedience; But if we obſerve them, we may prevent or remove the offence that is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken at them, by informing the people aright, that they are things in themſelves indifferent whereunto Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an liberty doth extend, and that the Magiſtrate ough<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

If ſo much paynes had beene taken to teach them obedience to lawfull authority, the ſcandall might have beene re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved long erenow. Whoſoever will be pleaſed to conſider theſe particulars ſhall finde, that what the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle hath ſpoken of Chriſtian liberty, &amp; of giving of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, makes nothing againſt our Ceremonies, but eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry way for them. Beſides thoſe two differences which I have obſerved, betweene their caſe of whom the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſpeakes, and ours: It were eaſie to ſhew many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things, wherein they are moſt unlike; namely the eating and not eating of meates, are private actions, in a mans owne power to doe or not to doe: But our caſe is concerning the publicke Ceremonies of the <hi>Church,</hi> which no private man can diſpenſe with. The Apoſtle by forbearing fleſh did prejudice none but himſelfe: But wee in refuſing the Ceremonies ſhould prejudice the authority of the Prince. The Apoſtles for bearance
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:14382:71"/>did further the courſe of his miniſtery, and therefore he became all unto-all; But our refuſall of the Ceremonies ſhould looſe us the liberty of ours, and that moſt juſtly for our diſobedience. Finally, amongſt the Romanes ſome were offended at the eating of thoſe meates, but I doe not reade that any was offended at the not eating of them: It is otherwayes with us, where one is offended at our Ceremonies, ten wiſer then they would be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended if we did not uſe them; And farre more if we did follow their faſhion in the manner of Gods wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.</p>
            <p>The caſe being cleere, that the Orders which our <hi>Church</hi> injoynes, are neyther contrary to Chriſtian liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, nor to that care wee ſhould have for to avoyd of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence; In the next place I will labour to finde out the cauſe of this groſſe miſtake in the brethren, which cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely is this, that they doe not rightly conſider the nature of Chriſtian liberty, whilſt they ſet it upon ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-hookes, and ſtretch it further then the nature there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of will beare; ſeeking not only a liberty of minde and conſcience in things indifferent, but a freedome alſo in their outward actions, which is not Chriſtian libertie,
<note place="margin">Calv. Inſt. lib. III. cap. 19. Sect. 10.</note> but licentious immunity, contrary to the doctrine of the Goſpell: for <hi>S. Peter</hi> exhorting all men to be obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent unto Magiſtrates,
<note place="margin">I. Pet. II. 16.</note> he warnes them not to <hi>uſe their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie as a cloake of maliciouſneſſe,</hi> Namely, In caſting off the bridle of governement. It is proper to the libertie of the Creator alone to be unlimited; but all lawfull li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie of the creature, is and muſt be bounded, not onely by the Law of charitie, (which theſe men will acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge) but alſo by the law of loyaltie; for if all reſtraint of the outward man were contrary to Chriſtian liberty; then were it not lawfull to obey the Magiſtrate in any thing; Then if the King ſhould be pleaſed to confirme the Orders, (or as they terme them the circumſtances of worſhip) which have beene uſed in their congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:14382:72"/>They were bound to forſake them, for the zeale of their Chriſtian libertie. And what is this elſe, but to bring flat Anabaptiſme and <hi>Anarchie</hi> into the <hi>Church,</hi> to overthrow all Governement, and diſſolve the bonds of ſubjection and obedience to lawfull authority. You ſhall therefore underſtand, that the Magiſtrate by his Lawes may moderate or reſtraine the outward actions, wherein the externall uſe of our liberty conſiſteth; The inward liberty of conſcience before <hi>God,</hi> notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding remayning intyre. He may injoyne any action which in <hi>Gods</hi> worſhip may be uſed lawfully; So that no opinion be put upon the conſcience, which taketh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the full reſpect of its indifferency. And this is that which <hi>S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Peter</hi> ſayes; We muſt obey the Magiſtrates, <hi>as free,</hi> that is, as being perſwaded that the thing com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded in it ſelfe, and to God-ward (as <hi>Calvin</hi> ſpeakes) is indifferent, and whether we doe it, or not doe it, in it ſelfe it commends us not unto <hi>God,</hi> otherwiſe then that by obeying of the Magiſtrate, we doe alſo obey <hi>God,</hi> who hath commanded us to be ſubject unto him. Which will better appeare if we conſider that Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an liberty is inward and ſpirituall, which may ſtand with the outward ſervitude of ſlaves (as the Apoſtle ſhewes. I. <hi>Cor.</hi> VII. 22.) much more with the obedience of free ſubjects: It is ſeated in the minde and conſcience, and reſpecteth nothing, but what is betweene <hi>God</hi> and us: It contenteth it ſelfe, if there be no opinion put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the conſcience of the neceſſity of theſe things, which <hi>God</hi> hath left indifferent: if they be not obtruded as di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Lawes: if no Religion be plac't in them, nor they preſſed as immediate parts of <hi>Gods</hi> worſhip. It is only the ſubjecting of the conſcience unto a thing indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent,
<note place="margin">I. Cor. VI. 12.</note> (which the Apoſtle calls, <hi>The bringing us under the power of a thing</hi>) which overthrowes our Chriſtian li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty: not the neceſſity of obedience unto lawfull au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority; but the doctrine or opinion of the abſolute ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:14382:72"/>of the thing it ſelfe. In a word Chriſtian libertie is not taken away by the neceſſity of doing a thing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different, or not doing; but only by that neceſſity which taketh away the opinion or perſwaſion of the indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency of it: As may appeare by this, whenſoever the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle condemnes the practiſe of Iewiſh Geremonies, at that time when there was ſome diſpenſation and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence granted unto Chriſtians, till the Synagogue ſhould be buried with honour; It is manifeſt that he condemnes not ſo much the uſe, as the doctrine and opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion which they had of them; becauſe they were urged and uſed, not as things indifferent, but as neceſſary unto ſalvation. For we know that he himſelfe many times did uſe them, which he would not have done, if they had beene then ſimplie evill: he circumciſed <hi>Timothie;</hi> and many Chriſtians who gave their lives for the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of <hi>Ieſus Christ,</hi> were circumciſed at that time, even after their converſion unto the faith; And yet when the falſe Apoſtles did urge the neceſſity of Circumciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he ſaid, <hi>If ye be circumciſed, Chriſt ſhall profit you nothing, Gal.</hi> V. 2, That is, If you bee circumciſed with an opinion of the neceſſity of that Ceremony, as if it did avayle unto juſtification, ſo he expounds himſelfe, ver. 4. <hi>Whoſoever are juſtified by the Law,</hi> (that is, ſeeke for Iuſtification by the Law) <hi>are fallen from Grace.</hi> That it was only the doctrine &amp; opinion they had of Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion at that time, which he condemnes, may appeare further by this, that thoſe Ceremonies were not prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed by a Civill Magiſtrate, who hath power to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund the outward man in the uſe of a thing indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, but only by ſeducing teachers, who had no power of bringing a neceſſity in the outward practiſe, but by perſwading and poſſeſſing mens mindes with an opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the neceſſity of theſe things, After the like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner doth the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> at this day tyrannize over the conſciences of men, equalling her conſtitutions un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

But our <hi>Church</hi> is farre from ſuch an uſurpation, ſhe doth place no Religion in them, aſcribe no holyneſſe unto them, nor obtrude them upon the conſcience as things neceſſary in themſelves, like <hi>Gods</hi> Commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: but only requires obedience unto her conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, thereby to reduce all her Children to an orderly Uniformity in the outward worſhip of <hi>God,</hi> And to this purpoſe ſhe hath ſufficiently declared the innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of her meaning, in the Articles of Religion, <hi>Artic.</hi> XX. <hi>The Church ought not to enforce any thing beſides the holy Writ to be beleeved of neceſſity for ſalvation:</hi> And in the <hi>Pre face</hi> before the Booke of Common Prayer, <hi>The Ceremonies that remaine, are retayned for a diſcipline and order, which (upon just cauſes) may bee altered and changed, and therefore are not to bee eſteemed equall with Gods Law.</hi> So that I can not but wonder at the impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencie of the Libeller, who changes our <hi>Church,</hi> as <hi>Christ</hi> doth the Phariſees, that ſhe makes the commandements of <hi>God</hi> of none effect by her traditions: Whereas the Phariſees did equall and preferre, their owne traditions unto the commandements of <hi>God,</hi> which is the thing for which they are condemned, as ſhall appeare unto any that reades the Text: But our <hi>Church</hi> is farre from ſuch preſumption, as may appeare by her doctrine pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed, which I have alleadged, as alſo by that which followeth in the ſame preface. <hi>In theſe our doings wee condemne no other nations, nor preſcribe any thing but to our owne people only. For we thinke it convenient, that every Countrey ſhould uſe ſuch Ceremonies, as they ſhall thinke best to the ſetting forth of Gods honour and glory, and to the reducing of the people to a moſt perfect and godly living without error or ſuperſtition.</hi> Now I have proved in my Sermon by Arguments unanſwerable, that the <hi>Church</hi> hath ſuch a power, to ordaine Ceremonies, and to make
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:14382:73"/>Lawes of things indifferent, <hi>for decencie and orders ſake;</hi> And that obedience ought to be given unto her conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions; Eſpecially conſidering that therein our <hi>Church</hi> was not only aſſiſted, but authorized by the Kings moſt excellent Majeſty, as the ſupreme Governor upon Earth, In all cauſes within his highneſſe dominions. And therefore I ſhall intreat my good brethren, if they will neyther deceive others, nor be deceived themſelves, that in this point of Chriſtian liberty, they would have alwayes one eye fixed upon the nature of things indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent, and the other upon the duty of a ſubject to his Soveraigne.</p>
            <p>And now having vindicated our <hi>Church</hi> from thoſe aſperſions caſt upon her of infringing Chriſtian liberty, and giving offence by her conſtitutions: I will in the laſt place, turne the Diſputers weapon againſt himſelfe, and cut off the head of that Philiſtine with his owne ſword; ſhewing that he and his fellowes, of all others are moſt injurious unto Chriſtian liberty,

The Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate hath this liberty, that he is not tyed to any parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Lawes which determine all things incident unto the outward form, of Gods worſhip, not mentioned in Scripture: But as the Iudiciall Law being-abrogate, it is lawfull for him to ordaine civill Lawes; ſo the Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall Law being aboliſhed, to eſtabliſh eccleſiaſticall conſtitutions, ſuch as are not repugnant unto the word of <hi>God.</hi> Theſe men deprive him of this libertie, they

<pb n="131" facs="tcp:14382:74"/>things, and layes no obligation upon the conſcience, by preſſing them as ſimply neceſſary in themſelves: but they make their negative reſtraints abſolutely neceſſary, place religion in them, binding their followers in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, not only to refuſe, but alſo to deſpiſe our Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies. Whereby they doe not only overthrow Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian liberty; but alſo are guiltie of the breach of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Commandement, by will-worſhip.

And as they are enemies to Chriſtian liberty, ſo they give juſt offence to all ſorts of men: To the Kings Majeſty, but their diſobedience to his Lawes; To the <hi>Church,</hi> by foule aſperſions, and ſeditious practiſes: They charge her with will-worſhip &amp; Idolatry, which is as much as to cal their mother whoore: Beſides it cannot but grieve her to be bereaved of her children, many of whom ſhe ſees following thoſe b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And now having diſcomfited the Diſputers forlorne hope; I come to grapple with his many forces, even with his <hi>Draconary milites,</hi> which he ſent to aſſault the reverent geſture, which we uſe at the receiving of the Sacrament. Where, though his Arguments ſeeme unto thoſe who looke upon them through the vapour of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection greater and goodlier then they are: yet if they would diſpell the miſts and cloudes of partiality, then thoſe reaſons which ſeeme Gyants in their eyes, would appeare like little dwarfes. In this Conflict, I confeſſe, my Anſwers were very briefe, denying only that Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition which was falſe, &amp; ſometimes giving inſtance to ſhow the abſurdity thereof: Intending to let the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſputer runne his witts out of breath, and then (if I had not been prevented by being put in mind of the danger of that publick diſputation) to reſume the ſumme of his proofes, &amp; make the Auditors ſenſible of the vanity of them. In the mean time I was forc'd to follow, or rather goe along with him in his wyld-gooſe-chaſe, through a rabble of intortuled Syllogiſmes, which to relate I ſhould even bluſh in his behalfe; And indeed the third part of them that are ſet downe in the Libell, were not uſed in the Court, but have been framed ſince by the Libeller, as are alſo the Anſwers fathered upon
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:14382:76"/>me, whereupon he builds the whole frame of his ſenſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe diſcourſe, fighting againſt his own ſhadow; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I can not build upon theſe Anſwers which he hath framed for me; but I muſt take the matter a-new into my hands, culling out every <hi>medium,</hi> which he uſed to inforce his Concluſion: and waighing them ſeverally in the ballance of reaſon. And beſides his bold alleadg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the example of <hi>Christs</hi> Inſtitution (whereof I will ſay nothing now,
<note place="margin">Sect. 31.32.33.34.35.</note> having ſo fully diſproved it in my Sermon; that he &amp; his fellowes may be aſhamed for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to abuſe the world with ſo falſe a pretence:) All his Arguments may be reduced unto theſe foure. I. That kneeling at the Communion hath been abuſed unto I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatry. II. That in uſing it there is danger of Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. III. That it hath an appearance of Idolatry and will-worſhip. IV. That to kneele at the Sacrament is Idolatry, at leaſt (as the Diſputer was pleaſed to ſpeake, without any preſident from the Schoole which he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver read) <hi>Corporall Idolatry.</hi> Theſe foure he confounded together, skipping from one to another, and back again to the former, like a man diſtracted of his ſenſes. But I muſt play the Chymiſt, to extract them, and put them in their ſeverall boxes, for the Readers better under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding.</p>
            <p>The firſt exception againſt Kneeling is, <hi>That it hath beene abuſed to Idolatry.</hi> What then? If that were a ſure rule, that all things which have been ſo abuſed, ſhould be aboliſhed, we ſhould leave our ſelves nothing which could be ſafely uſed: for there is none either of all <hi>Gods</hi> workes, or of the workes of man, but it hath in ſome place or other, been ſome way or other abuſed to Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry. How then could our conſciences be aſſured of the lawfull uſe of any thing which we uſe, whenas we are not ſure, whether the ſame thing in ſome other place be not made an Idoll? If there were any force in that Argument, it would conclude more ſtrongly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:14382:76"/>the Sacrament it ſelfe, which hath beene made an Idoll; then againſt Kneeling, which never was the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, but the naturall expreſſion of worſhip, commonly &amp; indifferently uſed, in true worſhip &amp; in falſe, by the ſervants of <hi>God,</hi> and by Idolaters. But here the Diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter tells us, that, <hi>The bread in the Sacrament is a holy and neceſſary thing which cannot be removed,</hi> Implying that Kneeling is not ſo. Here I will aske this wiſe man, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther before the Inſtitution of the Sacrament, it was not free for our Saviour to have ordayned the ſame in other Elements then bread &amp; wine? I thinke he will confeſſe that he might have appointed other things to bee the outward Elements in that Sacrament: So, then theſe Elements were neither neceſſary nor holy; yet did our Saviour make choyce of them, notwithſtanding that he knew how they had beene prophaned by Gentiles in their Idoll-ſervice:

Whereupon it neceſſarily followes, that the idolatrous or ſuperſtitious abuſe of a thing, makes it not altogether unfit for <hi>Gods</hi> ſervice. But he will ſay, <hi>Theſe were the creatures of God, and in things ordayned by God, the abuſe onely ſhould be taken away, and the uſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine; But not ſo in things ordayned by man, which have beene and are abuſed to Idolatry.</hi> Here it were ſufficient to overthrow all that he hath ſaid, to tell him, that albe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it bread and wine be <hi>Gods</hi> creatures, yet at this time whereof I ſpeake (namely before the Inſtitution of the Sacrament) they were not ordayned to be holy myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; And being before that time notoriouſly abuſed to Idolatry, (if his opinion were true) howſoever they might have remayned unto us for common uſe: yet they ought not to have been applyed to any ſacred ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, nor uſed in <hi>Gods</hi> worſhip. But becauſe be builds upon a diſtinction between the creatures &amp; ordinances
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:14382:77"/>of <hi>God,</hi> and the inventions of man; that the former be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing abuſed to Idolatry, the abuſe only is to be taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, &amp; the thing it ſelfe to be retayned: But the latter being ſo abuſed, uſe &amp; all is to be aboliſhed; And of this latter ſort he accounts Kneeling at the Communion. I will therefore take paines to examine this ground, and let him ſee upon what a rotten foundation he builds his houſe; firſt, The creatures &amp; ordinances of <hi>God,</hi> have not alwayes that priviledge, that though abuſed to Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, they are not to be deſtroyed, as may appeare by the brazen ſerpent, which was <hi>Gods</hi> ordinance: And by <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gags</hi> ſheepe,

And on the other part, ſome things deviſed by men, and abuſed to Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, have been imployed in the worſhip of <hi>God; Peter Martyr</hi> tells us out of S. <hi>Austin,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pet. Mart.

And he thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth that by the helpe of ſuch Images, the Text it ſelfe may be illuſtrated and better underſtood. And further he holds it not neceſſary, that the ſame Altar which hath beene abuſed unto Popiſh Idolatry, ſhould be alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; but that it may ſerve as well as a Table, for the uſe of the Sacrament. In which judgement,
<note place="margin">Foxe Pag. 1843.</note> diverſe Martyrs in Queene <hi>Maries</hi> dayes concurred, who were content to uſe the ſame Surplices and Chalices, which had beene uſed in the Popiſh maſſe.

            <p>But for all this they will ſay, <hi>Kneeling as the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was deviſed by the Papiſts.</hi> Surely, and if it were ſo, yet were not that a juſt exception againſt our geſture: for wee borrow many good Lawes from the Pagans, And as ſome flowers may grow in the wilderneſſe, ſo ſome things may proceed from haeretickes, and yet be convenient for the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>God.</hi>

               <hi>Non mihi perſuadeo Papatus im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pietatem eſſe tantam, ut quicquid attingit, omnino reddat contaminatum, quo bonis &amp; ſanctis uſui pio non poſſit conce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di.</hi> Albeit the <hi>Church</hi> of Rome be very foule, yet not like the uncleane bird in the Poet,

Yet is it moſt certaine that kneeling was not devyſed by the Papiſts, except only at the elevation of the conſecrated hoſt, which was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed by <hi>Honorius,</hi> the third and wherein they eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally commit Idolatry with their breaden-god, rather then when they receive the bread into their mouthes; for it is againſt the rule in the <hi>Church</hi> of Rome, for the people to worſhip any thing that is not higher then themſelves. But what is that to kneeling at the recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of the Sacrament, which was in uſe in the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>God</hi> many hundred yeares before Popery was hatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as is evident to all thoſe who have read the fathers, there being few of them which doe not mention the receiving of the Sacrament with adoration: And we know that the word adoration both in <hi>Scripture</hi> and in the Eccleſiaſticall writers, is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly uſed for outward worſhipping. I ſhal not need to labour to prove this, for theſe men with who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I have to doe, eſteem kneeling the only geſture of adoration, &amp; upon that ground do reject it, ſo that if they did receive adoring, they did receive kneeling.

            </p>
            <p>It is true indeed, that in the firſt Councell of <hi>Nice,</hi> there is a decree for ſtanding at prayer on the <hi>Lords</hi> dayes; But that was an exception from the generall rule of worſhip, upon a ſpeciall occaſion, which did not extend unto all ordinances, as may appeare by the end why it was ordayned, namely to confirme their <hi>Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chumeni</hi> in the faith of <hi>Christs</hi> reſurrection. Therefore howſoever they did ſtand at prayer, during that ſervice, which was called <hi>Miſſa Catechumenorum;</hi> yet not at the other, which was called <hi>Miſſa fidelium,</hi> wherein they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the Sacrament, their Novices being diſmiſſed. And ſurely it is abſurd to think, that becauſe they ſtood at prayer, therefore they ſtood at the Sacrament; for their ſtanding was uſed for commemoration of <hi>Christs</hi> reſurrection, but the Sacrament is ordayned for the commemoration of his death. Now, as the one requires a geſture to expreſſe confidence, ſo the other requires a geſture to expreſſe humilitie. But if I ſhould graunt, (which is moſt falſe) that when they did pray ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, they did receive ſtanding; yet that was only on the <hi>Lords</hi> dayes, and on the feaſt of Pentecoſt, &amp; we know that they did frequently aſſemble and receive the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament on the weeke dayes: Beſides before the decree of the Councell of <hi>Nice,</hi> for above 300. yeares, kneeling was in common practiſe in <hi>Gods</hi> worſhip, as the Canon it ſelfe declareth, and as it was uſed in prayer, ſo in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving of the Sacrament.</p>
            <pb n="141" facs="tcp:14382:79"/>
            <p>If any man ſhall aske me, When Kneeling began to be uſed by Communicants, ſeeing <hi>Chriſt</hi> did inſtitute the Sacrament in another geſture: I ſay, that I hold S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Auſtins</hi> rule to be moſt certaine, that <hi>whatſoever the Church hath obſerved generally in all places, at all times, and was not decreed by any Generall Councell, the ſame did proceede from the Apoſtles:</hi> But ſuch is kneeling at the Communion, It hath been uſed in all places, at all times, and was not decreed by any Generall Councell; and therefore did proceed from the Apoſtles. As after <hi>Christs</hi> reſurrection, his Diſciples prayed unto him kneeling, which they uſed not to do before; ſo it is more then likely that they received the Sacrament kneeling, the ſame being a reall prayer &amp; thankſgiving, and the higheſt part of <hi>Gods</hi> outward worſhip. If the geſture which <hi>Chriſt</hi> uſed with his Diſciples, was <hi>Accubitus,</hi> lying: It was certainely occaſioned by the conjunction of another meale, which did require an eaſie repoſe of the body; But when the other meale was removed, &amp; the Sacrament celebrate apart, there was no more uſe of that geſture, but the fitteſt geſture for the Sacrament was that; which is accounted moſt decent &amp; reverent in <hi>Gods</hi> worſhip.

            <p>This that I have ſaid is ſufficient to ſatisfie any mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate man, that kneeling at the Sacrament begun in the Apoſtles dayes; But if it did not, and was onely after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ordayned by their ſucceſſors; yet can it not be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed a humane invention: for it is a naturall geſture whereunto man is diſpoſed by his creation; And as all geſtures are from <hi>God,</hi> ſo the liberty of geſtures in <hi>Gods</hi> worſhip, is his ordinance, for he appointed that liberty of purpoſe, &amp; not forgetting (as man doth many things in making of Lawes) to make mention of them, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that no particular geſture in any Sacrament, under the Law, or under the Goſpell, nor in any other ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, was made neceſſary unto us by <hi>God,</hi> either by praecept, or by example: But the accommodation of the geſture to ſeverall parts of <hi>Gods</hi> worſhip, left alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether to the liberty of the <hi>Church.</hi> And the <hi>Church</hi> hath thought Kneeling the moſt decent and comely ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture to be uſed in the Sacrament, wherein her determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation is not to be eſteemed a meere humane conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: for if an Eccleſiaſticall Canon be made (as this is) of a thing indifferent, in a lawfull manner, to a lawfull end, by lawfull authority, according to the generall rules of Scripture; The ſame is approved in the ſight of <hi>God,</hi> as not meerely humane, but in ſome ſort divine, as is confeſſed by M. <hi>Calvin</hi> in theſe words;

            </p>
            <p>I have now proved both that all humane inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which have been abuſed, are not therefore to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boliſhed; (which I ſhall have occaſion to manifeſt fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hereafter) And alſo that Kneeling at the Sacrament is no humane invention: In the third place, I will make it appeare, that our Kneeling was never abuſed to Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry: for, as it was not deviſed by Papiſts, ſo we recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved it not from them. To let paſſe the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> where that geſture was intermitted for the ſpace of above forty yeares, till all memory of former ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition was paſt: Even in the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England;</hi> the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture of Kneeling was not continued, for, in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of King <hi>Edwards</hi> reigne, there was an intermiſſion for a ſpace, when all geſtures were free: But the <hi>Church</hi> afterwards perceiving the inconvenience thereof, thought fit to reduce all her Children to an Uniformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in <hi>Gods</hi> worſhip, by ordaining one geſture to be uſed in that Ordinance: And ſhe made choyce of Kneeling, not out of a deſire of conformity with Papiſts, or out of an honourable reſpect to their worſhip; But having a liberty of geſtures allowed her in <hi>Gods</hi> word, ſhe did judge Kneeling of all others, to be moſt fit, decent, and comely. But ſay that we had received that geſture from the Papiſts, (as we did Ordination, Baptiſme, and many other good things) yet it cannot be imagined, how they could abuſe that, which was never in their power to uſe: for the geſture which we uſe is our owne, the Papiſts never had the command of it.

I will now proceed further, and ſhew that it is not ſo much as of the ſame kind with theirs, being di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed from it by two or three ſubſtantiall diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences. The firſt is taken from the Agents, their knee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling is the geſture of Papiſts, ours of Catholickes: Now if Papiſts and Proteſtants be two diverſe kinds of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippers; (which I thinke the brethren will acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge) then their actions of worſhip, muſt be as diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent in kind, as be their Agents. The ſecond difference betweene their kneeling and ours, is taken from their different ends and objects, (which makes them yet more diſtant) for <hi>Actiones distinguuntur finibus,</hi> geſtures and actions are principally diſtinguiſhed by their ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects and ends: They in kneeling at the Sacrament, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip their breaden-god; Wee deteſt that abominable bread-worſhip, and worſhip only the great <hi>God</hi> of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and earth, in his owne Ordinance, &amp; his Son <hi>Ieſus Chriſt</hi> who ſitteth at the right hand of the Father in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly places. From theſe two differences there ariſes a third, that their kneeling is formally evill; Ours good and commendable: ſo that if any man for the abuſes of their kneeling, ſhall condemne ours, it is all one inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, as if ye ſhould condemne an innocent man for the crime of a malefactor;

               </gap>ed for their Altar; It being a uaturall geſture which <hi>God</hi> hath ſanctified for his wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and which theſe men themſelves uſe in other ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dances. And here I would be beholding unto the bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, if they would ſhew me a true reaſon, why it ſhould be lawfull for them to kneele in prayer, and not at the Communion, which is a reall prayer and thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving; When that geſture hath beene Idolatrouſly abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the Papiſts oftener in prayer then in receiving of the Sacrament, a thouſand times for one. Can the Popiſh abuſe of kneeling, make it uncleane to us in one Ordinance, and not alſo in another, where it hath beene more defiled? Let them wynd themſelves out of this if they can.</p>
            <p>I thought I had ſufficiently taken away the firſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, <hi>That kneeling at the Sacrament hath beene abuſed to Idolatry,</hi> by ſhewing that all things ſo abuſed are not to be aboliſhed, albeit the inventions of man; That kneeling is no invention of man, And that our kneeling neither was nor is abuſed to Idolatry: But peruſing the Libell againe, I find ſome Scripture alleadged by the Diſputer to prove his aſſertion, with as much fidelity, as the devill did alleadge Scripture in the Goſpell. Yet I will ſtay to examine it. The place is <hi>Deuter.</hi> XII. 4. <hi>Yee ſhall not doe ſo unto the Lord your God,</hi> and ver. 30.31. From whence he labours to inferre that it is unlaw full to kneele at the Communion, becauſe in ſo doing, <hi>Wee ſerve our God without warrant, as Idolaters ſerve their God contrary to that Commandement.</hi> Where this clauſe <hi>(without warrant)</hi> is inſerted by him, only to make way for an eſcape: But he will find his paſſage ſtop't, if he will be pleaſed but to obſerve what he may learne, from what I have already ſaid, eſpecially in my. Sermon, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:14382:82"/>that in the word of <hi>God,</hi> without relation to any Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall conſtitution, there is as much warrant for kneeling at the Sacrament, as for ſitting, ſtanding, or any other geſture, and more for kneeling then for either of them, the ſame being more ſutable unto worſhippers: And that now the <hi>Church,</hi> (according to that liberty which <hi>God</hi> hath allowed her to determine ſuch cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances) having ordayned that geſture, we have not only a warrant, but alſo a neceſſity: laid upon us to obſerve it; foraſmuch as it is neceſſary to obey authority, neceſſary to maintaine the Peace of the <hi>Church,</hi> neceſſary to preſerve the liberty of our mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſteries, neceſſary to receive the holy Sacrament: And as the caſe ſtands, unleſſe wee kneele, we diſobey authority, diſturbe the <hi>Churches</hi> peace, loſe the liberty of our miniſtery, and the comfort of the Sacrament. Let us ſee then whether kneeling at the Sacrament, come within the compaſſe of that prohibition, <hi>ye ſhall not doe ſo unto the Lord your God,</hi> namely as the nations did. And certainely that precept concernes not kneeling: for the nations bowed unto their gods, yet muſt we bow unto the Lord our <hi>God;</hi> for that <hi>Negative</hi> in the ſecond Commandement, <hi>Thou ſhalt not bow downe to them nor worſhip them,</hi> includes an affirmative. <hi>Thou ſhalt bow downe unto the Lord thy God, and worſhip him:</hi> Beſides, if we muſt not uſe any of theſe geſtures, which Idolaters have uſed in their Idol-worſhip, then we muſt not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip <hi>God</hi> at all; for if you take away all geſtures, you muſt take away all the outward worſhip of <hi>God,</hi> foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as it is not poſſible for us to worſhip <hi>God,</hi> but in ſome poſition of body: And take away one geſture up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that ground, that it hath beene uſed in Idol-worſhip; Then take away all: for all geſtures have been abuſed by Idolaters in their Idol-worſhip, and are common to them and us, in our ſervice of the true <hi>God;</hi> They kneele, ſo doe we; They ſtand, ſo doe we; They ſit, ſo doe we.
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:14382:83"/>And becauſe the Diſputer ſayes, <hi>A man cannot commit I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatry ſitting;</hi> I ſhall deſire him to conſider what the Apoſtle ſpeaketh of <hi>ſitting at Table in the Idols temple,</hi>
               <note place="margin">I. Cor. VIII. 10.</note> and what he may reade in prophane writers, how that ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting was commonly uſed at the ſacrifices of <hi>Hercules.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Macrob Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn. lib. III. c. 16.</note> But it is not heatheniſh Idolatry that offends theſe men, but Popiſh, &amp; that not ſo much in any other Ordinance, as in this of the Sacrament. Let them therefore know that all maine geſtures, have been applyed by the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts unto their Sacrament of the Altar, ſtanding, ſitting, kneeling; The Prieſt ſtands, the Pope ſitts, the people kneele. Now, ſhall it be unlawfull for us to uſe the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture of the people, and not alſo unlawfull to uſe the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture of the Pope? So that if that Commandement for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid one geſture uſed by Idolaters, to be uſed in the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of <hi>God,</hi> it forbids all, and makes more ſtrongly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, then againſt us.</p>
            <p>But indeed, neither that commandement, nor any other in the Word of <hi>God,</hi> can bee extended unto ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures, or any other actions which are lawfull in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, as ſhall eaſily appeare, if we take a view of the places. <hi>Deut.</hi> XII. 2.3.4.5. <hi>Yee ſhall utterly deſtroy all the places, wherein the nations which yee ſhall poſſeſſe, ſerved their gods upon the high mountaines, and upon the hills, and under every greene tree. And you ſhall everthrow their Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars, and breake their pillars, and burne their groves with fire, and you ſhall hew downe the graven linages of their gods, and deſtroy the names of them out of that place. Ye ſhall not doe ſo unto the Lord your God. But unto the place which the Lord your God ſhall chooſe out of all your tribes, to put his name there, even unto his habitation ſhall yee ſeeke, and thither thou ſhalt come.</hi> And againe ver. 30.31. <hi>Take heed to thy ſelfe that thou be not ſnared by following them, after that they be deſtroyed before thee, &amp; that thou enquire not after their gods, ſaying; how did theſe nations ſerue
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:14382:83"/>their gods? even ſo will I doe likewiſe. Thou ſhalt not doe ſo unto the Lord thy God: for every abomination to the Lord which he hateth, have they done unto their gods; for even their ſonnes and their daughters they have burnt in the fire to their gods.</hi> In which places foure things uſed by the Idolatrous nations, are forbidden and made unlawfull unto Gods people. I. Their Idols and Images of their gods, which muſt be deſtroyed, <hi>you ſhall hew downe the graven Images of their gods, and deſtroy the names of them out of that place:</hi> But what is this to our geſture of Knee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling at the Communion? Will any man reaſon from the aboliſhment of a ſubſtantiall Idoll-object of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, to naturall geſtures, which have ever been, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver will be common to the worſhip of damnable Idols, with that of the true God? II. He forbids the heathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh &amp; idolatrous manner of worſhip, ſuch actions and performances as were only applyed to falſe worſhip, &amp; are in themſelves ſimply evill, and ſo cannot be uſed to God. And hereunto onely the latter place which is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadged hath relation, as is evident in the Text, <hi>enquire not after their gods, ſaying; How did theſe nations ſerve their gods? even ſo will I doe likewiſe. Thou ſhalt not doe ſo unto the Lord thy God: for every abomination to the Lord which he hateth, have they done unto their gods; for even their ſonnes and their daughters they have burnt in the fire to their gods.</hi> Now, will any man ſay, that theſe actions have any Analogie with our kneeling unto God in any of his Ordinances, which was uſed in the worſhip of the true God, before ever it was given unto any Idol? III. The places of Idol-worſhip muſt be aboliſhed, for which there was a ſpeciall reaſon unto the Iewes, which doth not concerne us, <hi>God</hi> having made choice of mount Sion, to place his Name there. And thereunto eſpecially the firſt place hath reſpect, <hi>you ſhall burne their groves with fire, — yee ſhall not doe ſo unto the Lord your
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:14382:84" rendition="simple:additions"/>God,</hi> that is, you ſhall not ſerve him in Groves, or upon high mountaines, <hi>But unto the place which the Lord your God ſhall chooſe out of all your tribes, to put his Name there, even unto his habitation ſhall ye ſeeke, and thither thou ſhalt come.</hi> I hope no man from thence can inferre the aboliſhing of a naturall geſture, alwayes uſed in <hi>Gods</hi> worſhip. Laſtly, he commaunds them to deſtroy the inſtruments and appurtenances of Idolatrous worſhip, <hi>you ſhall overthrow their Altars, and breake their Pillars,</hi> of which ſort alſo are the ornaments of the Idols, expreſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly condemned <hi>Eſay</hi> XXX. 22. <hi>Yee ſhall defile alſo the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering of thy graven Images of ſilver, and the ornament of thy molten Images of Gold. Thou ſhalt caſt them away as a menſtruous cloth, Thou ſhalt ſay unto it, Get thee hence.</hi> From whence no man can prove the unlawfulneſſe of our geſture at the Communion, more then he can of the Sacrament it ſelfe. For I. Theſe inſtruments and orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments were artificiall things; Our geſture is naturall, &amp; ſo <hi>Gods</hi> creature, or an ability whereunto man is diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by creation; It is <hi>Gods</hi> Ordinance which he hath ſanctified for his owne worſhip, as may appeare both by precept and preſident in Scripture: And therefore according to their owne divinity, cannot be aboliſhed, albeit it hath been abuſed by Idolaters. II. Thoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments and ornaments were the ſame Individualls which were abuſed: ſo is not our kneeling at the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the ſame with the kneeling of either <hi>Pagan</hi> or <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt,</hi> as I have formerly proved. III. Theſe inſtruments &amp; ornaments did not firſt belong unto the ſervice of the true <hi>God,</hi> &amp; were from thence applyed unto the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of an Idoll. But were deviſed &amp; invented for the Idol-worſhip; But all geſtures, &amp; eſpecially kneeling, did from the beginning belong unto the ſervice of the true <hi>God,</hi> and were from thence transferred from <hi>Gods</hi> worſhip to Idolatry, by plaine theft, &amp; unjuſt alienation of his title and intereſt. Now, can there be an Act more
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:14382:84"/>juſt, then to give unto <hi>God</hi> that which is <hi>Gods,</hi> reſtoring the geſture of kneeling unto the true uſe, which Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters had ſacrilegiouſly uſurped.

Finally, thoſe inſtruments &amp; ornaments had no other uſe but for the honour of the Idoll: But our geſture of kneeling, as it is not uſed in honour of the Popiſh Maſſe, ſo it hath a needfull uſe in <hi>Gods</hi> worſhip, &amp; in this very ordinance, as after I ſhall declare. By this time (I hope) any man who hath the leaſt ſparke of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, may perceive to how little purpoſe the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſputer did alleadge that place of <hi>Deuteronomie:</hi> But I will goe further, &amp; direct him unto all thoſe places in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture which condemne either monuments of Idolatry, or communion with Idolaters, ſuch as are <hi>Gen.</hi> 35.4. <hi>Exod.</hi> 23.13.24.32. chap. 34.12. <hi>Levit.</hi> 18.3. chap, 19.19.27. <hi>Numb.</hi> 33.52. <hi>Deuter.</hi> 7.2.3.5. chap. 9.21. chap. 14.1. <hi>Ioſh.</hi> 23.7. 2. <hi>Kings</hi> 23.4.6. &amp;c. 1. <hi>Chron.</hi> 14.12. 2. <hi>Chron.</hi> 33.15. 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.16.17. <hi>Revel.</hi> 2.14. Let him now examine all theſe places, and he ſhall find that all which is condemned, is either one of theſe foure things, which before I mentioned in that place of <hi>Deuteronomie;</hi> or elſe meates ſacrificed unto Idols; (which yet are allowed out of the caſe of ſcandal, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.27.) or communion with Idolaters in their falſe worſhip: Or making of covenants &amp; leagues of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarity, eſpecially marriages with them: Or finally, civill uncleanneſſe, as making of baldneſſe upon their heads, marring the corners of their beards, uſing mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of cattell of diverſe kindes, and of linnen and woollen in the ſame garment, which did belong unto
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:14382:85"/>the Ceremoniall Law, whereby <hi>Gods</hi> people were ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from other nations, in many outward obſervances: But in all theſe places, or in any other place of Scripture there is nothing forbidden, which can by the leaſt Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie be applyed unto our kneeling at the Sacrament, or unto any other geſture which we uſe in any of <hi>Gods</hi> Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances. In a word as the Sunne, Moone, and Starres, which have beene notoriouſly abuſed to Idolatry, can not be deſtroyed, partly becauſe they are out of our power, and partly becauſe they are of durable neceility: Even ſo for the ſame reaſons, geſtures which have been abuſed, cannot be aboliſhed, becauſe ſuch geſtures as have been already abuſed by others, are out of our reach; and all geſtures are of durable neceſſity to mankind for ever.</p>
            <p>Now have I made it as cleere as the Sunne, that our kneeling at the Sacrament, is not to bee reckoned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt thoſe things which have been abuſed to Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and therefore is not to be aboliſhed: But becauſe they uſe this Argument againſt other Ceremonies of our <hi>Church,</hi> I wil looke more neerely into the true mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and intent of that Law, which <hi>God</hi> gave unto his people, for deſtroying the complements of Idolatrous worſhip, that thereby all men may judge how farre we are bound by that Commandement, to aboliſh things which have beene Idolatrouſly abuſed. And I find it moſt evident, that the ſtrictneſſe of that Law in reſpect of many things which were to be deſtroyed, concerned the Iewes only, as may appeare by theſe conſiderations following. I. God directs only his people what they ſhould doe in the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> as may bee ſeene <hi>Deuter.</hi> VII. 1. <hi>When the Lord thy God ſhall bring thee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the land whether thou goest to poſſeſſe it &amp;c.</hi> The like is <hi>Deuter.</hi> XII. 1.2.3.

            <p>Now let us apply theſe rules unto kneeling at the Sacrament, &amp; the reſt of the Ceremonies of our <hi>Church,</hi> and wee ſhall find that they have a good and profitable uſe in <hi>Gods</hi> ſervice, as I have ſufficiently proved in my Sermon: And that the Popiſh abuſe is not only ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, but altogether ſeparated from them: They are not uſed to the honour of any Idolatrous worſhip, but to the honour of the true <hi>God:</hi> They neither are nor can be ſnares to any; for a ſnare is that which is made of purpoſe to catch ſomething: And <hi>God</hi> condemnes on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thoſe things which are ſnares by their inſtitution &amp; nature; for the beſt thing in the world may become a ſnare through the corruption of man.

<pb n="159" facs="tcp:14382:88"/>from the Popiſh abuſe thereof: I will conclude all in this Syllogiſme:
<q>
                  <p>That which is no humane Invention, which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was abuſed to Idolatry, and hath a profitable uſe in the ſervice of <hi>God;</hi> ought not to be aboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed:</p>
                  <p>But our kneeling at the Sacrament is no hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Invention, was never abuſed to Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  <p>Therefore it ought not to be aboliſhed.</p>
               </q> I will alſo invert the Diſputers Argument upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe after this manner,
<q>
                  <p>That which is deviſed by man, and is abuſed to I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatry, ought to be aboliſhed:</p>
                  <p>But ſitting at the Sacrament is deviſed by man, yea by the man of ſin, and is by him no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toriouſly abuſed to Idolatry:</p>
                  <p>Therefore it ought to be aboliſhed.</p>
                  <p>And againe, That which was deviſed by man, hath been abuſed unto Idolatry, and hath no profitable uſe in Gods ſervice, but is an hinderance thereunto; ought to be aboliſhed:</p>
                  <p>But all Impropriations were deviſed by man, yea by the man of ſinne, have no uſe in Gods ſervice, but are a notable hinderance there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto:</p>
                  <p>Therefore they ought to be aboliſhed.</p>
               </q> Our brethren might doe well to make uſe of their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument againſt Impropriations, which they might doe more truely then they can againſt kneeling at the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or any other of our Ceremonies: but they are ſo farre from it, that they incourage both their Patrons and people, to devoure all manner of holy things, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they may be more able to be beneficiall unto them: Even as the Fryers in this Countrey, perſwade the people, that they may with a ſafe conſcience defraud
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:14382:89"/>both the Miniſter, and the ſecular Prieſt of their tythes, ſo that they make a Compenſation unto the fathers.</p>
            <p>I have inſiſted ſo long in the laſt point, that I muſt be very briefe in the reſt, that I may anſwer the impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of the Preſſe; and the rather becauſe I am ſure, that the grounds which I have laid already, partly in my Sormon, and partly in this diſcourſe are ſufficient, if they be duely conſidered, to cut off all the objections, which either have beene, or can be made againſt knee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling at the Sacrament, or any Ceremony of our <hi>Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſecond exception is, that in kneeling at the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>there is danger of Idolatry,</hi> or that it may be an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of Idolatry, inſomuch, <hi>That a Papiſt newly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, not having his underſtanding cleered from his old er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, hath opportunity left him to commit Idolatry as he did before.</hi> Here firſt I will recommend unto the Diſputer a neceſſary diſtinction uſed in the ſchoole:

Now to apply, kneeling being in it ſelfe a ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly geſture, is not dangerous in its owne nature; but acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentally through the corruption of man, who abuſes the beſt actions in the world: It is no otherwiſe an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of evill, then is the Law, the Goſpell, the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, <hi>Christ</hi> himſelfe, the <hi>Iſraelites Mannae,</hi> or the Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of the oxen placed in the Temple: yea there was no ſuch neceſſity of the oxen, as there is of kneeling in <hi>Gods</hi> worſhip, the ſame being a naturall geſture which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:14382:90"/>firſt to <hi>Gods</hi> ſervice, before it was applyed to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny idolatrous worſhip: Beſides it was never the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of worſhip, as was the Image of an oxe, but the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture which alwayes was, and ever will be common to true worſhippers and falſe. Next, if our kneeling at the Sacrament, be an occaſion of Idolatry; Then ſo is their ſitting bare, which they uſe not to doe in the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of the Word: And why may not the people, percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving them to give more reverence to the Sacrament, then to the Word, take occaſion from thence to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip it, as well as from our kneeling: for uncovering of the head is an expreſſion of worſhip, as well as knee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and (as I proved before) A man may commit Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry fitting. Againe, the error of the minde is the true occaſion of Idolatry, and not kneeling; If in time of our publick prayer, ſome ſuperſtitious perſons kneele, with ſecret reference to Saints departed (as they may doe) will any man affirme that their kneeling is the occaſion of their Idolatry, and not rather their minds, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing leavened with ſuperſtition, makes them uſe that ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture accordingly? So, it is not the Papiſts kneeling, but their erroneous doctrine that is the occaſion of their Idolatry: firſt, the falſe doctrine of the Sacrament corrupted their minds, and their minds becoming I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatrous, made their kneeling ſuch. Now the doctrine of our <hi>Church</hi> concerning the Sacrament is ſound, and doth ſufficiently acquit us from giving any occaſion of Idolatry; and doctrine is it which in all Religions de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termines the end and uſe of all geſtures. But here the Diſputer tells us, <hi>It is better to cloſe a pit wherein people may fall, then (leaving it open) to ſet one to bid people goe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it. O acumen Ariſtotelicum!</hi> he ſhould firſt have proved that kneeling is a pit, I have ſhewed that it is not, but ſurely his heart is a deepe pit of error and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipt: It is no blocke to ſtumble at; but the blocke is in his head,

And ſince ſome men will turne all geſtures into ſinne, it is enough for us, that the Word allowes them, we have a calling to uſe this geſture, and if we ſhould refuſe to uſe it, wee ſhould occaſion worſe effects, the diſturbing of the <hi>Churches</hi> peace, the loſſe of our Miniſtery, and of the comfort of the Sacrament; As theſe men doe by their diſobedience. So to turne to the Diſputers Argument againſt himſelfe,

If they ſhould expound that Text ſo as if the ſame were to be extended to all appearances of evill whatſoever, without any manner of reſtraint or modification: Then may we not doe good duties at any time, if the ſame have an appearance of evill unto others: Then muſt we condemne diverſe actions which are approved in the word of <hi>God:</hi> As <hi>Lacobs</hi> laying of rods before the cattell, had a manifeſt appearance of fraud; The <hi>Reubenites</hi> Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar had an appearance of defection from <hi>God,</hi> and of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration from their brethren; <hi>Ruths</hi> going to the bed of <hi>Boaz,</hi> had a manifeſt appearance of unchaſtity; <hi>Eziekiahs</hi> asking of a ſigne, had a ſhew of diffidence, and <hi>Davids</hi> dauncing before the Arke, of levity, <hi>Obadiah</hi> his falling on his face before the Prophet <hi>Elijah,</hi> had an appearance of Idolatry: The Apoſtle <hi>Pauls</hi> ſhaving of his head and purifying of himſelfe, was a ſhew of Iudaiſme; And his pleading that he was a Phariſee, to put diſſention be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the two ſects, might ſeeme diſſimulation and worldly policie.

This is to abſtaine from all appearance of evill, or (as the word beares) all evill appearance. And would to <hi>God</hi> that theſe mens diſciples had followed this adviſe, then ſhould they not have beene ſo much infected with the poyſon of their doctrine. II. The appearance of evill which we are to abſtaine from is not in reſpect of others, but in reſpect of our ſelves; We ſhould abſtaine from that which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares to us, after due tryall and examination to be evill<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for it is every man himſelfe that is to prove all things, that is all doctrines, and not others for him: And he is to keepe that which is good; not that which appeares good unto others; But that which he himſelfe, after tryall evidently finds to be good: And ſo he is to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaine from that which after tryall appeares evill unto himſelfe, whatſoever it appeare unto others. And ſo this is all one with that which the Apoſtle requires <hi>Rom.</hi> XIV. 5. <hi>Let every man be fully perſwaded in his owne mind.</hi> But then if any man ſhould apply this rule; to the practiſe of things indifferent, he muſt extend it no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, then to thoſe things, which are in our owne choyce, as not being determined by any conſtitution civill or Eccleſiaſticall. III. If the precept be extended unto thoſe things which appeare evill unto others, then thoſe <hi>others</hi> are only men of ſound Iudgement, <hi>rectè ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tientes,</hi> to whom nothing ſeemes evill but what indeed is evill: And ſo nothing is forbidden, but what is evill, (As the <hi>Syriack</hi> expreſſes it <hi>Abſtain from all kind of evill, or from every evill thing</hi>) As namely, intire familiarity with wicked perſons, and Communion with them in evill, which is not onely an appearance of evill, but evill it ſelfe. And ſo this precept is all one with that of the
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:14382:92"/>Apoſtle <hi>Iude,</hi> who borrowing a Metaphor from the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remoniall pollution of the Law, bids us <hi>Hate even that garment which is ſpotted by the fleſh</hi> ver. 23. Alſo the unſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable practiſe of holy duties without regard to the circumſtances of time and place comes within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe of that prohibition, as for a man to kneele downe and pray in the market place; And for the brethren to keepe their exerciſes in private conventicles, and at un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſonable houres: This is not only an appearance of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill, but evill, becauſe it is contrary to that diſcretion which <hi>God</hi> requireth, appointing every thing to be done in due ſeaſon, and in lawfull manner. But what is this to kneeling at the Sacrament? It cannot come with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the compaſſe of the Apoſtles prohibition: for it is not evill in it ſelfe, and it appeares not evil to us, we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fully perſwaded in our conſcience, both of the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe and expediency of it; Neither doth it ſeeme evill unto any Iudicious men, but only unto humorous fooles, whoſe heads are crazed in the principles of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding; for whoſe ſakes we ought not, nor can not abſtaine from it, conſidering firſt that the publicke do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine cleeres our practiſe, from all evill and appearance of evill: And if it were not for the doctrine of the <hi>Church,</hi> there is no geſture we could uſe in <hi>Gods</hi> wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, but it would carry a ſhew, both of heatheniſh and Popiſh Idolatry, foraſmuch as all geſtures have beene abuſed by them. Againe we have a lawfull calling for to uſe it, The Commandement of authority; And it is not a ſhew of evill in a thing indifferent, that can make it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull to him who hath an honeſt calling to uſe it. Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, if we ſhould refuſe this geſture for the pretended ſhew of evill, what other geſture can we uſe which hath not a greater appearance of evill? If we uſe ſitting, it hath a manifeſt appearance of unreverence, prophane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, contempt of the holy Sacrament; And refuſing to kneele being commanded, hath more then a ſhew of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogance,
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:14382:92"/>pride, preſumption, of faction and diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. But for any to refuſe ſo farre, as rather then kneele, to loſe their miniſtery, and the comfort of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is not only an appearance, but a pregnant evidence of vile hypocriſie, while they ſtraine at a gnat and ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low a Camell, refuſing the greateſt good, for avoyding of that, which is but by miſconſtruction, a ſhew of evill, to ſome few people only, whom they themſelves have deluded. But the Diſputer will prove our kneeling at the Sacrament to bee an appearance of Idolatry, And how? He tells us <hi>The body goes as farte as it can goe, if it would commit Bread worſhip</hi> (pardon me good Reader for preſenting thee ſuch non-ſenſe) And againe that <hi>When we kneele, our outward behaviour is as like the Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous kneeler, as can be; ſo that none can tell whether we wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip God, or the bread.</hi> And that <hi>A Magiſtrate can doe no more (for his heart) when he would ſuppreſſe Idolatry, then curb the outward expreſſions of it; for the heart no man can know whether it be committing Idolatry or not, but by the outward acts.</hi> This miſerable man is ſo blinded, that hee is a fitter object of pitty, then ſubject of inſtruction: for hee will not conſider, that all geſtures are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to true worſhippers and falſe: That kneeling did firſt belong unto <hi>Gods</hi> ſervice, and albeit it bee now u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by Idolaters by unjuſt alienation, yet it is fit that we ſhould give unto <hi>God</hi> that which is his owne, he having ſayd: <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto me every knee ſhall bow:</hi> That un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe we uſe theſe geſtures in the worſhip of <hi>God,</hi> which are uſed by Idolaters, (And ſo our behaviour be as like theirs as can be) we ſhall uſe none at all: And take away all geſtures, then take away the whole outward wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of <hi>God:</hi> That it is not the outward geſture which diſtinguiſheth betwixt a true worſhipper, and an Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but their Doctrine and Profeſſion. I will now fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther tell him, that our kneeling at the Sacrament is no liker the <hi>Papiſts</hi> kneeling, then their ſitting is like
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:14382:93"/>unto the <hi>Popes,</hi> except only that they have not ſo great a ſhew of <hi>devotion.</hi> And <hi>as a Magiſtrate can doe no more when he would ſuppreſſe Idolatry, then reſtraine the outward act:</hi> So our Kings Majeſty, when he would bring theſe men to an orderly forme in <hi>Gods</hi> worſhip, he can doe no more but injoyne the outward expreſſion thereof by a decent and reverent <hi>kneeling;</hi> hee can not roote out of their harts, unreverence, prophaneneſſe, arrogancy, pride, praeſumption, and hypocriſie; which are the only true cauſe of their oppoſition. Now as to his other a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperſion, that <hi>kneeling is an appearance of Will-worſhip.</hi> I ſhall need to ſay no more, then I have already, when I treated of Chriſtian liberty, namely that we doe not place either Worſhip or Religion in that geſture, nor lay any opinion upon the conſciences of people of the neceſſity thereof: But ſuch is his ignorance, that hee can not diſtinguiſh between theſe things, <hi>Quae ſpectant ad cultum,</hi> which belong unto the worſhip of <hi>God,</hi> and wherein it conſiſts; And thoſe things <hi>Quae conducunt ad cultum,</hi> which only conduce unto <hi>Gods</hi> worſhip, as the changeable circumſtances of time and place, and the outward forme and order of Adminiſtration, of which ſort is our kneeling at the Communion, but a changeable circumſtance, albeit of all other geſtures, the moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent expreſſion of worſhip. And ſo not being eſteemed by us to be worſhip, it can not be called <hi>Will-worſhip.</hi> Beſides, we have a warrant from the Word, both by precept and preſident, to kneele in <hi>Gods</hi> ſervice. But as for them who make ſitting neceſſary and eſſentiall unto the Sacrament, as a part of <hi>Chriſts</hi> Inſtitution, without any warrant from the Word; And who bind the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of their people by their negative precepts, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe our Ceremonies; I have proved both in my Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, and in this diſcourſe, that they are guilty of will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worſhip in the higheſt degree. So that the Diſputer al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadged that place <hi>Col.</hi> II. 23. againſt will worſhip, in an
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:14382:93"/>ill houre to his owne head: for theſe men whom the Apoſtle charges with will worſhip, did not urge the neceſſity of doing any thing which <hi>God</hi> had not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded, but the neceſſity of abſtayning from ſome things, which <hi>God</hi> had not prohibited, as may appeare by the words going before, <hi>Touch not, Taſte not, Handle not:</hi> So that there may be will-worſhip, in making con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of abſtayning from a thing that is indifferent, as if it were in it ſelfe unlawfull; as well, as in placing Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion in the obſervation of it. This is indeed the bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threns caſe: They bind the conſciences of men under paine of ſinne, not to kneele, not to croſſe, not to weare a ſurplice, and in a word not to obſerve any thing injoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in our <hi>Church:</hi> whereby they are as guilty of will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worſhip as the falſe Apoſtles were; And beſides their will-worſhip, they are guilty of diſobedience, which the falſe Apoſtles were not: for there was no comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement to injoyne <hi>Touching, Tasting, Handling;</hi> But they were things left unto their owne power; whereas our Ceremonies are injoyned by lawfull authority. And now to turne his weapon againſt himſelfe,
<q>
                  <p>That which carryes a greater appearance of unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence, prophaneneſſe, contempt of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, arrogancie, pride, praeſumption, faction, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience &amp; hypocriſie; then kneeling doth of Idolatry: Is to be avoyded.</p>
                  <p>But ſuch is ſitting at the Sacrament, and refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to kneele when they are injoyned. <hi>Ergo &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
               </q> That geſture ſhould not be uſed in the Sacrament, which is uſed by the Pope: Nor our behaviour like his, for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voyding the appearance of Idolatry:
<q>But ſuch is ſitting. <hi>Ergo</hi> &amp;c.</q> They who place Religion in a thing indifferent, and lay an opinion upon the conſciences of people of the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of it: As alſo they who teach men to place Religion
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:14382:94"/>in abſtayning from things indifferent, albeit commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by lawfull authority, are guilty both of will-wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and diſobedience:
<q>But the brethren doe ſo, as I have even now declared. <hi>Ergo</hi> &amp;c.</q>
            </p>
            <p>I am now come unto the laſt exception, <hi>That knee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in the Act of receiving is Idolatry.</hi> Here the Diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter doth not ſpeake, but mutter: he dares not directly charge us with <hi>Idolatry;</hi> (for any thing I can find in the Libell) yet he labours to inſinuat ſo much unto his credulous diſciples, giving this as a reaſon of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing that geſture. <hi>Leſt it be the inducement or very act of Idolatry.</hi> Which is, (as I obſerved before) <hi>Superſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſa timiditas, A feare where no feare is.</hi> Againe he tells us, That <hi>Christ uſed not kneeling</hi> (namely in the Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Sacrament) <hi>to prevent all Idolatry.</hi> This is a bold, yea an impudent aſſertion: for hee knowes not what geſture <hi>Chriſt</hi> uſed; Neither doth it appeare un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelfe did receive the Sacrament; But that he miniſtred the ſame unto his diſciples: And if they did not kneele, it was not upon that ground, to prevent Idolatry; But, (as I have manifeſted in my Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon) becauſe this Sacrament was celebrated with the conjunction of another meale, which did require a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture of eaſe: And becauſe he did in a manner conceale the glory of his God head, till after his reſurrection, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch that in the dayes of his fleſh, his Diſciples did not in their ordinary prayers kneele unto him as the object of joynt adoration. Beſides, the forbearing of this geſture cannot prevent Idolatry; for I have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly proved, that a man may commit Idolatry ſitting as well as kneeling. But here the Diſputer tells us, <hi>A man cannot commit [Bodily Idolatry] ſitting, which he may doe kneeling.</hi> By which very Phraſe, all men may ſee that theſe men take upon them to coyne a <hi>new divinitie:</hi> for I have read of <hi>materiall</hi> and <hi>formall Idolatry;</hi> But I dare
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:14382:94"/>ſay that the diſtinction of <hi>Corporall</hi> and <hi>Spirituall Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try</hi> was never heard of, (at leaſt in this ſenſe) till theſe <hi>Empyrickes</hi> did invent it. But I will pardon him his i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnorance, as I have done many greater offences: for I find by another place in the Libell, what miſleades him: He ſayes <hi>There is an outward worſhip as well as an inward,</hi> And therfor he thinkes there ſhould be an outward, or (as he termes it) <hi>Bodily Idolatry.</hi> But he is not ſo lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned as to know the difference betweene <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="172" facs="tcp:14382:95"/>(as they doe) and for the honour of that bable, to break Lawes, deſpiſe authority, trouble the <hi>Churches</hi> peace, &amp; forſake their Miniſtery. So that the Libeller ſpeakes more truely then he is aware, and like <hi>Balaams</hi> aſſe, to the underſtanding of others, though not to his owne; when he brings in <hi>B.D.</hi> ſaying, <hi>There is no Idolatry but in thy brayne I dare ſay.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I thought to have inſiſted long on this point, to prove that it is not only lawfull, but alſo expedient to worſhip <hi>God</hi> before a creature occaſionally, whether conſecrated or not conſecrated, of holy ſignification o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

When he was told that a man may lawfully kneele downe and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip <hi>God</hi> before his bed, and that not only caſually but occaſionally, having a reſpect unto that reſt which he deſires to receive in his bed, under the protection of the Almighty: And that it is no other wayes we worſhip <hi>God</hi> in and before the Sacrament: He ſayeth <hi>That the bread in the Sacrament is an Idolizable object, and when men kneele before their bed they doe it not in reverence of their bed, and they k<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>ele before the Elements, we doe it in reverence of the myſteries, and before that which hath beene committed Idolatry with.</hi> I will now briefely referre unto his wiſer thoughts theſe conſiderations following. I. That there is nothing in this world which is not (to uſe his own: Phraſe) <hi>Idolizable,</hi> even a mans
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:14382:95"/>owne bed: The Apoſtle ſpeaking of <hi>Epieures,</hi> ſayes <hi>Their belly is their God:</hi> So it may be ſaid of ſome voluptuous men who glut themſelves with eaſe, ſleepe, and fleſhly pleaſure; <hi>Their bed is their God.</hi> II. There was a time when the Sacrament had never beene abuſed to Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, namely before theſe 800. yeares he ſpeakes of, and if it was lawfull then to kneele in receiving, it is ſtill law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full unto us; for I have proved at large that the abuſe of kneeling by others, makes not that geſture uncleane un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us, the ſame being a naturall geſture which <hi>God</hi> hath ſanctified for his owne worſhip. I will goe further and juſtifie that if a man were caſt into <hi>Groanland,</hi> where for diverſe months he wanted the light of the ſunne, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards upon the firſt returne of the ſame, it were not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull for him to fall downe upon his knees, &amp; praiſe <hi>God</hi> for the comfort of that light, albeit the Sunne of all other things hath beene made the greateſt Idol, and is the ſame <hi>Individuall</hi> body which hath beene ſo abuſed. III. If there be any force in that Argument or rather aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion, it makes more ſtrongly againſt the Sacrament it ſelfe, then againſt kneeling in <hi>Gods</hi> worſhip: for it was the bread which was made the Idol, and not kneeling, which being a naturall geſture, alwayes was and ever will be common to true worſhippers and falſe. IV. It is a ſhameleſſe calumnie in the Diſputer to charge us tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> we kneele in reverence of the myſteries.
<note place="margin">Lerit. 19.30.</note> We profeſſe indeed to reverence them, for there is reverence due to all holy things, which for diſtinctions ſake we call not worſhip, but <hi>Veneration:</hi> yet that is not the ground or cauſe of our kneeling; but a conſequent that iſſues from the geſture: our kneeling <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>
               </note> But to ſpeake properly, the veneration of the Elements ſtands not in
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:14382:96"/>ſpeciall geſtures directed unto them, but only in comely and decent uſing of them. V. Albeit we neither kneele to the Elements, nor in reverence of them; yet we wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip <hi>God</hi> receiving the Sacrament, with a religious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect unto the ſame, as unto that which miniſters unto us the preſent occaſion of worſhip.

<pb n="175" facs="tcp:14382:96"/>worſhip a creature, becauſe we are called to worſhip <hi>God</hi> at or before his footſtoole: So would they prove that we unlawfully worſhip the Sacrament, becauſe we worſhip <hi>God</hi> at or before it. But theſe two muſt be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed, The former never was, is, nor can be lawfull: But the latter namely, to worſhip <hi>God</hi> in his owne Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance, and ſo before a creature occaſionally, is not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly lawfull, but ſometimes neceſſary, as the former in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances doe ſufficiently declare. But here I know they will ſay, They had a ſpeciall warrant for what they did, which we have not. To let paſſe what I have manifeſted before in this diſcourſe, that we have warrant both by precept and preſident to kneele in any part of <hi>Gods</hi> worſhip, and conſequently in receiving of the bleſſed Sacrament: I will deſire them firſt to conſider, that if to worſhip before a creature, were all one as to transferre adoration unto it, (as they underſtand the matter) then no warrant could make it lawfull: it is ſo neceſſarily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant unto the eternall Law, that <hi>God</hi> could not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand it: <hi>for God cannot deny himſelfe,</hi> and he ſayeth:
<note place="margin">Iſa. 42.1.</note> 
               <hi>My glory I will not give unto another.</hi> Againe there was no Commandement for <hi>Ioſhuah</hi> and the Elders of <hi>Iſrael</hi> to fall downe before the <hi>Arke,</hi> nor for any other before <hi>Davids</hi> time, yet they did it as lawfully before as after: no Commandement to worſhip before the <hi>Clowdie pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,</hi> nor before the <hi>glory of the Lord</hi> which came downe upon the houſe, nor before the fire and the ſacrifices: no Commandement for the people to fall downe and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, when they heard the word of the Lord from <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, Aaron,</hi> and <hi>Iehaziel.</hi> So though we had no particular warrant, yet were it lawfull for us to kneele at the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, as it was for them upon theſe occaſions I have now mentioned. I will yet cleere the matter by other inſtances. The Apoſtle ſpeaking of a ſinner convinced by prophecying ſayeth, <hi>That falling downe on his face,
<note place="margin">I. Cor. 14.25.</note> he will worſhip God, and report that God is in them:</hi> The mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters

            <p n="6">VI. I deſire the Diſputer and his fellowes to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that many of their owne faction in <hi>England,</hi> though they kneele not in the act of receiving, yet they doe kneele in bleſſing of the Elements and giving thankes: And they themſelves uſe to ſtand, &amp; exhort the people to humble themſelves, and to pray unto <hi>God</hi> for a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing: here is worſhip before the Elements, with a religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous reſpect unto them; for which they have no more
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:14382:97"/>warrant either by commandement, or by the example of <hi>Chriſts</hi> Inſtitution, then we have for kneeling in the act of receiving. And of the twaine it ſeemeth rather to be Idolatry, to worſhip in beholding the Elements, then in receiving of them; for no man can be ſo mad, as to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip that which he is tearing with his teeth. VII. They ſit uncovered before the Elements, with a religious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect unto them, which they uſe not to doe in hearing of the word: Now uncovering the head is a geſture of worſhip, as well as kneeling; If the one be Idolatrous, ſo is the other; neither have they any more warrant ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by commandement, or by the example of <hi>Chriſts</hi> Inſtitution, for the one then we have for the other. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, they uſe diverſe other expreſſions of worſhip, as lifting up of the eyes and hands unto Heaven, which is daylie uſed by the Prieſt in the Maſſe; And ſometimes weeping, which hath been abuſed to Idolatry, as by the women whom the <hi>Prophet</hi> ſaw mourning for <hi>Tammuz,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ezek. 8.14.</note> a <hi>Prophet</hi> of an Idol, for whom there was a ſolemne mourning once a yeare in the night: yet have I ſeene many of their diſciples, not only lift up their eyes and hands unto Heaven; but alſo weepe when they recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the Sacrament, and that, (as I charitably beleeve) out of a godly ſenſe of their owne miſery, and of <hi>Gods</hi> mercy. Now were it not ſtrange if our kneeling onely ſhould be Idolatrous, and not alſo thoſe other geſtures, which are expreſſions of worſhip, and have been abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to Idolatry, as much as kneeling. Finally, I deſire him to remember what I have often ſaid, that all ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures being common to true worſhippers and falſe, it is onely the publicke doctrine, and received opinion, that determines the uſe and end of all geſtures, and puts a difference between the ſervants of <hi>God,</hi> &amp; worſhippers of Idols; Inſomuch that, (as I told him in the Court) If the firſt Reformers of our Religion, had onely changed the geſture from kneeling to ſitting; &amp; not the doctrine
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:14382:98"/>touching the Sacrament it ſelfe; Idolatry would have remayned.

<pb n="181" facs="tcp:14382:99"/>any geſture. Againe his aſſumption that kneeling was avoyded in all the Sacraments is either uncertaine, or falſe, or both, for he himſelfe cannot tell me what ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture was uſed in any Sacrament either under the Law, or under the Goſpell, except only in the <hi>Paſſeover,</hi> and in that too, the geſture was changed from ſtanding to lying, without any ſpeciall direction from <hi>God.</hi> And as for Baptiſme it is more then probable, that the geſture uſed by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and others in that age, was kneeling: for they went downe into the water, and their whole body head and all was immerſed in the water, which could not have beene if they had ſtood upright, without dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of drowning: They muſt needs therefore kneele or bow their body, <hi>adorationis in modum,</hi> which is all one. Beſides, all who came to be baptized (<hi>Chriſt</hi> excepted) did confeſſe their ſinnes, call upon <hi>God,</hi> and tender a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all homage unto him: Now what geſture is ſo fit for confeſſion of ſinne, prayer and performing of homage; as is kneeling:
