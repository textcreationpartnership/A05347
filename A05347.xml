            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

But for all this, They perÅ¿iÅ¿t in their errors, grow more reÅ¿olute in their oppoÅ¿ition, and more dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent to draw diÅ¿ciples after them,
<note place="margin">Revel. 12.12.</note> like unto him of whom it was Å¿aid: <hi>He is come downe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you having great wrath, becauÅ¿e hee
<pb facs="tcp:14382:4"/>knoweth that he hath but a Å¿hort time.</hi> So that it may be Å¿aid of them, as the Prophet of the hard hearted <hi>Iewes,
<note place="margin">Ierem. 5.3.</note> Lord thou haÅ¿t Å¿tricken them, but they have not Å¿orrowed, thou haÅ¿t conÅ¿umed them, but they have refuÅ¿ed to receive correction, they have made their faces harder then a Å¿tone, and have refuÅ¿ed to returne.</hi> And this is no new thing for haere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tickes to bee confirmed in their errors by their Å¿ufferings; It was obÅ¿erved in ancient time, that not only <hi>ChriÅ¿tianitas,</hi> but even <hi>haereÅ¿is mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tibus creÅ¿cit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And Å¿urely I have many times wondered how thoÅ¿e men who are none of the learnedest, Å¿hould be able to draw Å¿uch a faction after them, and bewitch the minds of the people: for every one of theÅ¿e <hi>Presbyteriall Dictators</hi> is more eÅ¿teemed then the whole <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> they take upon them to teach their mother to give Å¿uck, the people have plucked out their owne eyes, and given to their teachers, being now able to Å¿ee nothing but through their spectacles, unto whom they doe aÅ¿cribe more then <hi>Papall Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility.</hi> But I find that it hath beene Å¿o in former times, that in a faction neither the learnedeÅ¿t
<pb facs="tcp:14382:4"/>men, nor the beÅ¿t, but the moÅ¿t factious are regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. <hi>Primianus</hi> and <hi>Maximianus</hi> were the heads of the two factions of the <hi>DonatiÅ¿ts,</hi> and Å¿ayeth <hi>S. AuguÅ¿tin:</hi> It was well for them that faction fell out, elÅ¿e <hi>Primianus</hi> might have beene <hi>PoÅ¿tremianus,</hi> and <hi>Maximianus, Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimianus:</hi> But now in Å¿chiÅ¿me either of them was a jolly fellow, and the head of a party: So faction gaines theÅ¿e men more eÅ¿teeme, then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiÅ¿e they could either have, or deÅ¿erve in Gods <hi>Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And beÅ¿ides their forwardneÅ¿Å¿e to lead a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, I have obÅ¿erved diverÅ¿e other meanes wherby they have wonne the affection of the people unto a generall liking of their cauÅ¿e; <hi>I.</hi> A great Å¿hew of holyneÅ¿Å¿e, like the <hi>Encratites</hi> of old, who termed all other ChriÅ¿tians that lived not in like auÅ¿terity <hi>PÅ¿ychicos,</hi> that is, carnall: And yet even in this they come farre Å¿hort of that mortification, which was either in <hi>Pelagius</hi> of old, or is at this day in the <hi>Socinians,</hi> whom I may juÅ¿tly terme <hi>Å¿entinam haereticorum,</hi> the worÅ¿t of haeretickes. <hi>II.</hi> Their diligence in prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, which yet in them is, rather the labour of the lungs, then of the brain, and (I thanke <hi>God</hi>)

For 1. the occaÅ¿ion of that prohibition, was the am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition of the Å¿onnes of <hi>Zebedee,</hi> who dreaming of a temporall kingdome that ChriÅ¿t Å¿hould have in this world, deÅ¿ired to Å¿it, one on his right hand, the other on his left; that is, to be the greateÅ¿t in that kingdome: They did not deÅ¿ire IuriÅ¿diction over MiniÅ¿ters onely, and place above ApoÅ¿tles,

IV. It cannot be denyed, but that the ApoÅ¿tles did (du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring their life) exerciÅ¿e IuriÅ¿diction over all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther EccleÅ¿iaÅ¿ticall perÅ¿ons. So did their Å¿ucceÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ors
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:14382:11"/>who are Å¿tiled Rulers: Therefore ruling is not forbidden the ApoÅ¿tles. yea, our Saviour in the Å¿ame place intimates, that among them, Å¿ome Å¿hould bee greater than others, Å¿aying, <hi>Let the greatest among you, bee as the leaÅ¿t, and the chiefest as hee that Å¿erveth.</hi> Finally, the oppoÅ¿ition between Gentiles and <hi>you,</hi> doth evidently prove, that that precept is given to all ChriÅ¿tians. <hi>The Kings of the Gentiles exerciÅ¿e dominion over them â but it Å¿hall not be Å¿o amongst you.</hi> If his intent had been to forbid ruling in MiniÅ¿ters onely, he would not have oppoÅ¿ed them to the Gentiles, but to tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall men in ChriÅ¿tian Common-wealthes, or rather to the PrieÅ¿ts under the Law, Å¿aying: <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongÅ¿t the PrieÅ¿ts of IÅ¿rael Å¿ome rule over other: but it Å¿hall not bee Å¿o among you.</hi> But to Å¿ay, it is thus with the Gentiles, it Å¿hall not be Å¿o with you Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niÅ¿ters, is no good oppoÅ¿ition. And, it is thus with the Gentiles, it Å¿hall not bee Å¿o with you ChriÅ¿tians, is a full and a fit <hi>antitheÅ¿is,</hi> often uÅ¿ed in Scripture. <hi>Matth. VI. 7. But when yee pray, uÅ¿e not vaine repetitions, as the Gentiles doe. Matth. VI. 31. Take no thought, for after all thoÅ¿e things Å¿eeke the Gentiles. I. TheÅ¿Å¿. IV. 5. Not in the luÅ¿t of concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piÅ¿cence, as doe the Gentiles.</hi> Still Gentiles oppoÅ¿ed to ChriÅ¿tians, no-where to MiniÅ¿ters. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in that place nothing is forbidden to Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ters, but what is unlawfull to all ChriÅ¿tians. Not Å¿uperioritie, authoritie, dominion, LordÅ¿hip, but the ambitious affectation of the Å¿ame, and the ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannicall uÅ¿age thereof. So that (my maÅ¿ters)
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:14382:12"/>If you will make uÅ¿e of that Text againÅ¿t our au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, you muÅ¿t turne plaine AnabaptiÅ¿ts, and condemne not only EccleÅ¿iaÅ¿ticall authoritie, but Civill alÅ¿o: for ChriÅ¿t Å¿peakes there to his DiÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, not as ApoÅ¿tles, but as ChriÅ¿tians, and Å¿o hee doth in my Text, <hi>If thy brother treÅ¿paÅ¿Å¿e against thee;</hi> for the dutie here required, is not proper to MiniÅ¿ters, but Å¿uch as concernes all ChriÅ¿ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, to beare offences patiently, to deÅ¿ire the Å¿al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of our brother, and to that end to admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niÅ¿h him privately, or (if need be) to deferre the matter to the Church. And therefore it is to bee obÅ¿erved, how in the next words, Å¿peaking of a power proper to the ApoÅ¿tles, and their Å¿ucceÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ors, he changeth the number, to Å¿hew the change of the perÅ¿on, though hee bee Å¿till Å¿peaking to his DiÅ¿ciples.

But when hee comes to Å¿peake of the power of the Keyes, which was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven onely to the ApoÅ¿tles, and their Å¿ucceÅ¿Å¿ors, he uÅ¿eth the plurall number, <hi>WhatÅ¿oever you Å¿hall bind,</hi> even <hi>you,</hi> who are the PaÅ¿tors and Rulers of my Church, in earth.</p>
            <p>In the next place,
<label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">sect. </seg>4</label> wee are to Å¿ee, of whom hee Å¿peakes: of a brother, <hi>If thy brother treÅ¿paÅ¿Å¿e,</hi> one that profeÅ¿Å¿eth ChriÅ¿t; for this courÅ¿e which our Saviour preÅ¿cribeth to admoniÅ¿h our brother, &amp; if need bee to convent him before the Church, is
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:14382:12"/>not to bee taken with thoÅ¿e who are altogether without the pale of the Church, as the ApoÅ¿tle Å¿heweth 1. <hi>Cor. V. 9. I wrote unto you not to companie with fornicators, yet not altogether with the fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of this world â for then must yee needs goe out of the world â If any man that is called a brother be a fornicator â with Å¿uch an one cate not.

            </p>
            <p>In the third place,
<label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">sect. </seg>5</label> wee are to enquire of what Å¿innes he Å¿peakes: Certainely, he meanes princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally and properly, private injuries, whereby thy brother hath wounded thee, either in thy body, or eÅ¿tate, or reputation. <hi>If hee Å¿inne against thee.</hi> And Å¿o <hi>Peter understood it,</hi> verÅ¿. 22. where he Å¿aith, <hi>MaÅ¿ter, how often Å¿hall my brother Å¿inne against me, and I forgive him.</hi> Yet by Analogie wee are to underÅ¿tand it of all Å¿innes, and the Å¿ame courÅ¿e which is here preÅ¿cribed, is to bee obÅ¿erved with a brother, that Å¿innes againÅ¿t God onely; that is, wee are to admoniÅ¿h him; and if need bee, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent him before the Church. For ChriÅ¿t heere exhorts us to charity; that which he will have us principally to Å¿eeke, is not Å¿atiÅ¿faction for the wrong done unto us; but as it is called in the Text: <hi>the gayning of our brother,</hi> that is, his Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. If our Saviour had reÅ¿pected onely the wrong done to us, he would never commaund us to complaine; for hee compelles no man to Å¿ue for Å¿atiÅ¿faction when he is wronged: albeit he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits us to uÅ¿e lawful meanes to right our Å¿elves;
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:14382:13"/>Yet hee would bee well pleaÅ¿ed, if wee would Å¿it downe by the wrong. I am Å¿ure the ApoÅ¿tle who was inÅ¿pired by the Å¿pirit of ChriÅ¿t, adviÅ¿eth this as the beÅ¿t of all. <hi>Why doe ye not rather take wrong? &amp;c. I. Cor. VI. 7.</hi> But here hee commaunds us to convent our brother offending, before the Church, if he will not heare us, and therefore that which hee would have us ayme at principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, is, his Å¿alvation, which is in danger, if he be not recovered by repentance, not only when he hath wronged us, but alÅ¿o when he hath offended God in any Å¿ort. Againe, wee ought to bee Å¿o zealous of God's glory, that wee Å¿hould account Å¿innes againÅ¿t God, to bee againÅ¿t our Å¿elves. God is Å¿o Å¿enÅ¿ible of the injuries done unto us, as if done to himÅ¿elfe: <hi>In all their troubles he was troubled,</hi> Å¿ayth the Prophet <hi>IÅ¿ay, LXIII. 9.</hi> And God himÅ¿elfe, <hi>Zach. II. 8. He that toucheth you, toucheth the apple of mine eye.</hi> When <hi>Saul</hi> did perÅ¿ecute the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers upon earth, the Head cryed from Heaven: <hi>Saul, Saul, Why perÅ¿ecuteÅ¿t thou me?</hi> In like manner Å¿hould wee bee Å¿enÅ¿ible of the injuries done to God, accounting them as done to our Å¿elves, as was <hi>David,</hi> who Å¿ayth, <hi>The rebukes of them who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke the Lord, have fallen upon mee.</hi> In a word, as an offence done to thy neighbour, is a Å¿in againÅ¿t God, in regard of the breach of his Commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: So an offence againÅ¿t God, is a Å¿in againÅ¿t thy neighbour, in regard he is Å¿candalized by thy bad example. Finally, in other places, the like courÅ¿e is preÅ¿cribed in other offences, beÅ¿ides
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:14382:13"/>private injuries. <hi>Levit. XIX. 17. Thou Å¿halt not hate thy brother â but plainely rebuke him.</hi> Tit. III. ver. 10. <hi>A man that is an hereticke, after the firÅ¿t and Å¿econd admonition, reject.</hi> So that not onely private wrongs are to bee brought before the Church, but other offences alÅ¿o, for it is not likely, that ChriÅ¿t would have the <hi>Church</hi> to cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ure offences againÅ¿t our neighbour, and to ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect the Å¿innes committed againÅ¿t the <hi>first Table.</hi> But ChriÅ¿t mentioneth onely private injuries, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauÅ¿e hee is exhorting to Patience, and Charitie. And we are moÅ¿t Å¿enÅ¿ible of thoÅ¿e offences, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we are hurt: he therfore reÅ¿trayneth us, where wee are moÅ¿t forward, knowing well, that if wee can be kept from the violent proÅ¿ecution of thoÅ¿e wrongs which are done to our Å¿elves, wee will be Å¿low enough, in taking notice of other Å¿innes, committed againÅ¿t God, and our neighbour.</p>
            <p>And now, having found out both the perÅ¿ons,
<label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">sect. </seg>6</label> and the offences Å¿poken of: In the next place, let us conÅ¿ider the rule preÅ¿cribed, or the courÅ¿e that is to bee taken, <hi>If thy brother Å¿hall treÅ¿paÅ¿se a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainÅ¿t thee.</hi> It is a <hi>Recipe,</hi> for curing an offending brother, wherin our Saviour will have us to deale like tender PhyÅ¿icians, who firÅ¿t uÅ¿e to try gentle remedies; and if that will not doe, they miniÅ¿ter Å¿tronger pills, that are more offenÅ¿ive to Nature. So Å¿hould we doe; for, the Cure here preÅ¿cribed, is fourefold. The I.

Now wee muÅ¿t not thinke, that all theÅ¿e degrees can be obÅ¿erved at all occaÅ¿ions, and as oft as our brother offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth. Sometimes the offence is Å¿o light, that it is better to paÅ¿Å¿e it by, then to take notice of it. Sometimes, though the Å¿inne be great, yet it is committed Å¿o privatelie, that it is to no purpoÅ¿e for thee to tell it unto the Church; for if he deny it, thou canÅ¿t not prove it.

As it is the generall cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tome of our Countrey to Å¿it at meate, Å¿o it is the cuÅ¿tome of our <hi>Church</hi> to kneele at the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> neyther ever had the <hi>Catholicke Church,</hi> any Å¿uch cuÅ¿tome, as to receave Å¿itting.

Finally, If there be a neceÅ¿Å¿ity of Å¿itting, becauÅ¿e it is a table ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ture, the priviledge of a feaÅ¿t, and the prerogative of gueÅ¿ts; there muÅ¿t be the like neceÅ¿Å¿ity of other deportments uÅ¿ed in civill eating, which are as proper to the nature of a feaÅ¿t, and the preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of gueÅ¿ts, as Å¿itting is: And then why doe yee not receive the <hi>Sacrament</hi> in your dyning roomes? for the <hi>Church</hi> is not a fit place to eate &amp; drinke in: Why doe you not Å¿alute and welcome one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother before you Å¿it downe, as the manner is at Civill FeaÅ¿ts? why doe you not uÅ¿e trenchers, napkins, knives, as well as Å¿tooles? why doe you not eate a full meale, feede heartily, drinke oftner then once, and pledge one another? for all theÅ¿e doe belong to a liberall and honourable inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainement, Å¿uch as your authors Å¿ay muÅ¿t bee in

            <p>Thus I have clearely proved,
<label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">sect. </seg>33</label> that the geÅ¿ture which <hi>ChriÅ¿t</hi> uÅ¿ed in the inÅ¿titution of this <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> was not Å¿itting: for either he uÅ¿ed the Å¿ame geÅ¿ture in the <hi>Evangelicall Supper,</hi> which he did in the <hi>Legall,</hi> or hee uÅ¿ed another: if hee continued the Å¿ame geÅ¿ture, it was not Å¿itting, but either Å¿tanding, or rather lying: if he uÅ¿ed another, you your Å¿elves know not what it was, and I dare boldly Å¿ay, that it is more likely to have beene ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Å¿hould become neceÅ¿Å¿ary, without any Å¿peciall commaund. IV. <hi>God</hi> hath fully expreÅ¿Å¿ed, what is neceÅ¿Å¿ary to bee obÅ¿erved in any of his Ordinances: But in all the <hi>Booke of God,</hi> there is not one word expreÅ¿Å¿ing what geÅ¿ture wee Å¿hould uÅ¿e in the <hi>Sacrament:</hi> all the <hi>EvangeliÅ¿ts</hi> are Å¿ilent in this matter; Å¿o is <hi>S.

If you Å¿ay, that you have the example of ChriÅ¿t and of his DiÅ¿ciples, that will not Å¿erve your turne; for you know not what geÅ¿ture they uÅ¿ed; and albeit wee were certaine that they had Å¿ate, as you doe, yet that would not binde us to i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation, without Å¿ome other direction; for doubtleÅ¿Å¿e, if <hi>ChriÅ¿t</hi> had meant, that his geÅ¿ture in that <hi>Sacrament</hi> Å¿hould be exemplary unto us, hee would have put upon it Å¿ome marke of immuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie, conÅ¿idering that from the beginning of the world, no geÅ¿ture in any <hi>Sacrament</hi> or Å¿ervice was obligatory unto <hi>God's</hi> people by example. V. If the geÅ¿ture which <hi>ChriÅ¿t</hi> uÅ¿ed in the miniÅ¿tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> was Å¿itting or lying; the Å¿ame was occaÅ¿ion all from the <hi>PaÅ¿Å¿eover,</hi> as were many other circumÅ¿tances, which you your Å¿elves doe not obÅ¿erve.

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="11"/> Christ</hi> put on his up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per garment, after hee had waÅ¿hed his <hi>DiÅ¿ciples</hi> feete, before he celebrated the <hi>Sacrament:</hi> yet you will not be perÅ¿waded by that example, to put on a Surplice; and I am Å¿ure it is as eaÅ¿ie, from <hi>Christs</hi> upper garment, which he put on when he went to the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> to conclude for a Surplice, or a <hi>Cope</hi> either, as it is from <hi>ChriÅ¿ts</hi> geÅ¿ture, to conclude a neceÅ¿Å¿ity of Å¿itting at the <hi>Communion.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="12"/> ChriÅ¿t</hi> and his <hi>DiÅ¿ciples</hi> leaned one in anothers boÅ¿ome; Å¿o doe not you.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="13"/> Finally, <hi>ChriÅ¿t</hi> and his <hi>DiÅ¿ciples</hi> had their heads covered: you as yet have the manners to Å¿it bare: In all theÅ¿e, you Å¿warve as much from the example of <hi>ChriÅ¿t,</hi> as we doe by kneeling: for as theÅ¿e were changeable circumÅ¿tances, Å¿o is the geÅ¿ture changeable, &amp; inferiour to many of them. For they are expreÅ¿Å¿ely mentioned in <hi>Scripture:</hi> but there is not one word of the geÅ¿ture. Some of them were circumÅ¿tances of choyce, as namely<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> 
               <hi>ChriÅ¿ts</hi> bleÅ¿Å¿ing of the Elements apart: But the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ture (if it was Å¿itting or lying) was only occaÅ¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onall. Some of them were continued in the <hi>Church</hi> many hundred yeeres, and namely the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumÅ¿tance of time, the Sacrament being celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted after Supper, according to <hi>ChriÅ¿ts</hi> example, (and in many places of <hi>Africke</hi> they obÅ¿erved the very day, even the firÅ¿t day of the weeke) till the <hi>Å¿ixth Councell</hi> at <hi>Constantinople</hi> did appoint the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament</hi> to bee celebrated in the morning, when
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:14382:44" rendition="simple:additions"/>men are moÅ¿t apt for devotion: But you are never able to Å¿hew, that the geÅ¿ture (if it was Å¿itting) was uÅ¿ed in any <hi>Church.</hi> I might adde many other things wherein you follow not the example of <hi>ChriÅ¿t,</hi> becauÅ¿e you know it not. Wee know not what forme of Bread <hi>Christ</hi> uÅ¿ed, what kinde of Wine, what faÅ¿hion of Cup, what manner of Tablecloath, what words he uÅ¿ed, in bleÅ¿Å¿ing and giving thankes, after what manner hee brake the Bread, and powred out the Wine into the Cup, what quantitie of Bread and Wine they did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, and how long they were about that action. All which are of greater importance, then the geÅ¿ture, which (as I have Å¿hewed before) was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver immutable in any Ordinance, but alwayes free. Therefore you Å¿hall doe well, for Å¿hame, (if not for conÅ¿cience Å¿ake) not to take the holy name of <hi>Christ</hi> in vaine, by pretending his example, for Å¿itting at the Communion, Å¿eeing you doe not imitate his example in many other things, more materiall then the geÅ¿ture.</p>
            <p>In the laÅ¿t place,
<label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">sect. </seg>35</label> that if the geÅ¿ture of <hi>ChriÅ¿t</hi> and his <hi>DiÅ¿ciples,</hi> in the firÅ¿t inÅ¿titution, was Å¿itting, wee ought not to imitate it. For there is great difference betweene the eÅ¿tate of the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles</hi> then, and ours now: betweene <hi>ChriÅ¿ts</hi> eÅ¿tate of humiliation, and his eÅ¿tate of exaltation: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene his preÅ¿ence in humility,
<note place="margin">Matth. XX. 28.</note> and his preÅ¿ence in glory. In his firÅ¿t comming he came not to be Å¿erved, but to Å¿erve:
<note place="margin">Ioh. XV. 15. Luk. XXII. 27.</note> He made himÅ¿elfe familiar with his <hi>DiÅ¿ciples,</hi> uÅ¿ed them as his friends &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:14382:45"/>and he himÅ¿elfe was amongÅ¿t them, as one that Å¿erveth. And therefore they did never kneele downe to him in their ordinary prayers, nor pray unto <hi>God,</hi> particularly in his name, as he Å¿ayth, <hi>Ioh.</hi> XVI. 24. <hi>Hither to have yee aÅ¿ked nothing in my name.</hi> It is certain that the <hi>DiÅ¿ciples</hi> did pray unto <hi>God,</hi> and did pray in the name of a mediator in generall, elÅ¿e their prayers could not have been heard: But at that time, they did not make expreÅ¿Å¿e mention of him in their prayers, in regard their knowledge of his <hi>Godhead,</hi> and of his Mediator<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿hip, was but obÅ¿cure and imperfect, and they then did not thinke, that hee who was daily converÅ¿ant with them upon earth, was alÅ¿o pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ent with the Father making interceÅ¿Å¿ion for them. Yea at that time <hi>ChriÅ¿t</hi> did not deÅ¿ire, to be worÅ¿hipped as <hi>God,</hi> Coeternall, CoeÅ¿Å¿entiall and ConÅ¿ubÅ¿tantiall with the Father, for he comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded his <hi>DiÅ¿ciples</hi> to conceale the glory of his Godhead,

               <note place="margin">Matth.

               <note place="margin">Act. <hi>VII.</hi> 59.</note> who before were rude and ignorant, did preach him openly, and pray unto him by name, and that upon their knees. Now, if the <hi>ApoÅ¿tles,</hi> after his reÅ¿urrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, when they were filled with the <hi>Spirit,</hi> did pray unto him kneeling, which they had not uÅ¿ed to doe before; why may wee not think, that then they alÅ¿o received the <hi>Sacrament</hi> kneeling, albeit before they did Å¿it with him at table, while hee was pleaÅ¿ed to uÅ¿e them as his companions, and when their knowledge was but rude and unper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. Sure I am, it doth not become us now for to
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:14382:46"/>challenge to be Å¿o familiar with him at his table, as were his <hi>DiÅ¿ciples</hi> in the dayes of his fleÅ¿h. Thus have I clearely proved, both that it is moÅ¿t un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely, that <hi>ChriÅ¿t</hi> and his <hi>DiÅ¿ciples</hi> Å¿ate in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿titution of the <hi>Sacrament;</hi> and alÅ¿o that though it were certaine they did Å¿it, yet the example of their geÅ¿ture doth not binde us to imitation. But I have forgot my Å¿elfe to inÅ¿iÅ¿t Å¿o long upon this Argument. My purpoÅ¿e at firÅ¿t was onely, to give an inÅ¿tance of your Å¿itting at the <hi>Communion,</hi> as a Ceremonie uÅ¿ed by you in the Å¿ervice of <hi>God,</hi> without any Å¿peciall warrant: but when I conÅ¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, that this is the very <hi>Diana</hi> for which you Å¿trive, and the wall of Å¿eparation between you &amp; the <hi>Church;</hi> I thought fit to inlarge my Å¿elfe upon this point, to manifeÅ¿t unto all thoÅ¿e who love the trueth, that Å¿itting hath no more ground in <hi>Christ's</hi> InÅ¿titution, then kneeling.</p>
            <p>And now to proceed,
<note place="margin">Sect. 36.</note> I will Å¿hew you other Ceremonies uÅ¿ed by you in Gods worÅ¿hip, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Å¿peciall warrant. The next to Å¿itting at the <hi>Communion,</hi> is Å¿prinkling in <hi>BaptiÅ¿me,</hi> for which there is no warrant, but the cuÅ¿tome of the preÅ¿ent <hi>Church:</hi> for the auncient Ceremonie in BaptiÅ¿me, was not aÅ¿perÅ¿ion, but immerÅ¿ion, which Ceremonie was Å¿anctified by the <hi>BaptiÅ¿me</hi> of our <hi>Saviour,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Matth. III. 16. Mark. I. 10.</note> for the <hi>EvangeliÅ¿ts</hi> Å¿ay, <hi>When he was baptized, he came out of the water,</hi> and therefore he went in into the water. The Å¿ame was uÅ¿ed by the <hi>ApoÅ¿tles,</hi> and thereunto the <hi>ApoÅ¿tle</hi> alludeth, Å¿hewing that the mortification of Å¿inne, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaÅ¿e
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:14382:46"/>of that mortification, and the vivification of the new man, are Å¿ignified by the Ceremonie of <hi>BaptiÅ¿me,</hi> for the dipping in <hi>BaptiÅ¿me</hi> had three parts, their going down into the water, their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance in the water, and their comming up out of the water. The going downe into the water, figureth the mortification of Å¿inne by the power of <hi>Christs</hi> death, <hi>for all wee</hi> (Å¿ayeth the ApoÅ¿tle) <hi>which have beene baptized into IeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t, have been baptized into his death:</hi> The continuance in the water, noteth the increaÅ¿e of that mortification, by the power of <hi>Christs</hi> death and buryall; <hi>We are buryed with him by BaptiÅ¿me into his death:</hi> The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming up out of the water, ratifieth our riÅ¿ing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine unto newneÅ¿Å¿e of life; <hi>Like as Christ was rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ed from the dead, to the glory of the Father, Å¿o wee alÅ¿o Å¿hould walke in newneÅ¿Å¿e of life,</hi> Rom. VI. 3.4. This Ceremonie was continued in the <hi>Church</hi> for many hundred yeares, and to that purpoÅ¿e in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient times, they had places in each Church for dipping, called <hi>BaptiÅ¿teria</hi> and <hi>Lotiones:</hi> neither was Å¿prinkling generally practiÅ¿ed in the <hi>Church,</hi> till 1300. yeares after ChriÅ¿t; when (to uÅ¿e your owne words) <hi>AntichriÅ¿t</hi> was in his full height. Now can you Å¿hew me any reaÅ¿on, why you may leave a Ceremonie which was certainly uÅ¿ed by <hi>ChriÅ¿t,</hi> by his <hi>Apostles,</hi> and the whole auncient <hi>Church,</hi> and was of Å¿ingular uÅ¿e for fignification; and in Å¿tead of it, take another not Å¿o Å¿ignificant, brought into the <hi>Church</hi> by <hi>AntichriÅ¿t?</hi> And that yet it Å¿hall not bee lawfull for the whole <hi>Church,</hi>
               <pb n="76" facs="tcp:14382:47"/>to lay downe another Ceremonie, (to wit, Å¿itting at the <hi>Communion</hi>) whereof there is no certainty nor likely hood, that ever it was uÅ¿ed by <hi>ChriÅ¿t,</hi> or his <hi>ApoÅ¿tles,</hi> or any <hi>Church</hi> in the world; and in place of it, to uÅ¿e another, which is a great deale more decent and comely. Thirdly, you uÅ¿e to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyne pennance, &amp; to receive penitents in a white Å¿heet: and I am Å¿ure, that if a Surplice in Gods Service, be a Ceremonie, Å¿o is a white Å¿heet in pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blick pennance and abÅ¿olution, and there is no more warrant for the one, then for the other. Fourthly, you uÅ¿e a Ceremonie in Marriage, by joyning of hands, and pronouncing of words, which are not commaunded. Fiftly, I could tell you, that the time was in the dayes of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿byterie, when that <hi>Church,</hi> whoÅ¿e orders you Å¿o much approve, did uÅ¿e a Ceremonie in Ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and a very Å¿trange one: It was not impoÅ¿iti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of hands, but Å¿haking them by the hand, to bid them welcome into their Societie, becauÅ¿e forÅ¿ooth, they were loath in any thing, to have a conformitie with the auncient <hi>ApoÅ¿tolick Church.</hi> Sixtly, you profeÅ¿Å¿e to honour the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neva,</hi> as a fit patterne unto all other <hi>Churches,</hi> and yet they uÅ¿e the Ceremonie of godfathers in <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiÅ¿me,</hi> and wafer Cakes in the <hi>Communion,</hi> againÅ¿t which one Ceremonie, I could Å¿ay more, then can be Å¿aid againÅ¿t all the Ceremonies of our <hi>Church.</hi> Finally, the lifting up of the eyes to Heaven, the Å¿preading out of the hands, the knocking of the breaÅ¿t, Å¿ighing and groaning in Gods Å¿ervice, are
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:14382:47"/>Ceremonies, uÅ¿ed by none Å¿o much, as by your Å¿elves; And yet I confeÅ¿Å¿e, that if they proceed from a Å¿incere heart, they are lawfull expreÅ¿Å¿ions of devotion. By this time you doe all Å¿ee, that whereas you deny Ceremonies in Gods worÅ¿hip, which are not commaunded, you are evidently convinced by your owne practiÅ¿e.</p>
            <p>I thinke that I have Å¿aid enough,
<note place="margin">Sect. 37.</note> to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw that ground which you have laid, that no Ceremonies ought to bee uÅ¿ed in Gods Å¿ervice without a Å¿peciall warrant from the word. Now for the concluÅ¿ion of this poynt, I will appeale unto the confeÅ¿Å¿ions of the reformed <hi>Churches,</hi> and the Å¿uffrages of divines. You profeÅ¿Å¿e to approve the <hi>Articles</hi> of the <hi>Church of England,</hi> as contay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning nothing but trueth, (though not Å¿o manie particulars, as you account to be matters of faith) and thoÅ¿e Articles doe aÅ¿cribe Å¿uch a power to the <hi>Church</hi> to ordaine Ceremonies, as you may Å¿ee in the <hi>XX.</hi> Article: <hi>The Church hath power to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree rites or Ceremonies.</hi> and againe in the XXXIIII. Article, <hi>Every particular or Nationall Church, hath authority to ordaine, change, and aboliÅ¿h Ceremonies.</hi> The Å¿ame you may reade in the Articles of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of the Church of <hi>Ireland,</hi> which were prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the dayes of Queene <hi>Elizabeth.</hi> As for the Iudgement of other Reformed Churches I Å¿hall referre you to the <hi>Harmony of ConfeÅ¿sions,</hi> and the writings of their learned Divines, where you may learne. I. That it is not only lawfull, but expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent and requiÅ¿ite, to uÅ¿e Ceremonies in <hi>Gods</hi> wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿hip.
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:14382:48"/>II. That thoÅ¿e Ceremonies Å¿hould be Å¿igni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficant. III. That it is not neceÅ¿Å¿ary that the Å¿ame Ceremonies bee obÅ¿erved in all <hi>Churches,</hi> at all times. IV. That we are not bound to obÅ¿erve all thoÅ¿e Ceremonies, which were uÅ¿ed by the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles,</hi> and the <hi>Primitive Church.</hi> V. That we may retain Å¿ome Ceremonies uÅ¿ed by the <hi>Iewes,</hi> name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ceremonies of order, not of prefiguration. VI. That we may uÅ¿e Å¿ome Ceremonies uÅ¿ed by the Pagans.

               <hi>Calvin</hi> requireth three conditions: That they have, <hi>In numero paucitatem, in obÅ¿ervatione facilitatem; in Å¿ignificatione dignita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem.</hi> I. For number they Å¿hould be few; for when the <hi>Church</hi> is peÅ¿tered with the multitude of them, it makes the eÅ¿tate of <hi>ChriÅ¿tians</hi> to be more intollerable, then the condition of the <hi>Iewes,</hi> as it is in the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> whoÅ¿e miÅ¿Å¿alls are lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger then the booke of <hi>Leviticus,</hi> whereof <hi>GerÅ¿on, Polydore Virgill,</hi> and others did complaine in their time. II. They Å¿hould bee eaÅ¿ie for obÅ¿ervation. III. For Å¿ignification they Å¿hould be grave, decent and comely; not fooliÅ¿h and ridiculous, as are the apiÅ¿h geÅ¿ticulations in the <hi>MaÅ¿Å¿e,</hi> and many other
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:14382:48"/>Ceremonies uÅ¿ed in that <hi>Church,</hi> as their manifold croÅ¿Å¿ings, kiÅ¿Å¿ings, kneelings, whiÅ¿perings, waÅ¿h<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, anointings, Å¿pittings, blowings, breathings, and a number of the like. Unto theÅ¿e three con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, I will adde two more. I. Ceremonies muÅ¿t not be injoyned, as things in themÅ¿elves ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿olutely neceÅ¿Å¿ary, and wherein <hi>Gods</hi> worÅ¿hip doth conÅ¿iÅ¿t. II. We muÅ¿t not aÅ¿cribe unto them Å¿pirituall effects, as the <hi>Papists</hi> doe, who Å¿ay that their croÅ¿Å¿ing, and Å¿prinkling of holy water, are effectuall to purge away veniall Å¿innes, drive a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way <hi>divells,</hi> and Å¿anctifie the parties. Now the Ceremonies injoyned by our Church, have all theÅ¿e conditions. For number, they are few, as ever was in any <hi>Church;</hi> for obÅ¿ervation, eaÅ¿ie; for Å¿ignification, worthy; for quality, grave, decent and comely; for antiquity, reverend; The worÅ¿hip of <hi>God</hi> is not placed in them, neither are they preÅ¿Å¿ed upon the conÅ¿ciences of people, as things in themÅ¿elves neceÅ¿Å¿ary, like the Commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of <hi>God:</hi> we aÅ¿cribe no merit, remiÅ¿Å¿ion of Å¿innes, nor other Å¿pirituall effects unto them. Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally they are purged from the droÅ¿Å¿e of all <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piÅ¿h</hi> Å¿uperÅ¿tition. And therefore you are bound in conÅ¿cience to obÅ¿erve them, they being injoyned by lawfull authority.</p>
            <p>And now I am come to the laÅ¿t thing wherein the power of the <hi>Church</hi> is to bee conÅ¿idered,
<note place="margin">Sect. 38.</note> and that is for <hi>correction.</hi> The Church hath authority to cenÅ¿ure her diÅ¿obedient children, whether they be <hi>Heretickes</hi> or <hi>SchiÅ¿matickes,</hi> or inordinate
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:14382:49"/>livers; And on the other part, upon their repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, to reÅ¿tore, releaÅ¿e, and abÅ¿olve them. Like a good Mother Å¿he hath both <hi>Vbera</hi> and <hi>Verbera,</hi> a <hi>d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I was not Å¿o happy in the Å¿ucceÅ¿Å¿e, in regard of the difference, betwixt his auditors and mine; his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king conÅ¿cience of the truth, and accounting it Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to reverence their BiÅ¿hop, and to beleeve him as Gods meÅ¿Å¿enger: but mine reÅ¿olved never to forÅ¿ake their opinions, though the truth were made never Å¿o evident unto them, having Iudgements foreÅ¿talled with praejudice, againÅ¿t whatÅ¿oever Å¿hould be Å¿poken by a BiÅ¿hop, whom to deÅ¿piÅ¿e they account it the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eÅ¿t perfection of Religion. BeÅ¿ides the weakeneÅ¿Å¿e of their underÅ¿tanding is Å¿uch, that they were not capable, either of Arguments or anÅ¿wers, but tranÅ¿ported with the opponents Å¿ighes, groanes, lifting up of his eyes, &amp; Å¿preading out of his hands; being the beÅ¿t Arguments which ever theÅ¿e zelots learned in the Schooles: And indeed of no Å¿mall waight with the common people; As the Orator well knew, when being in a certaine de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence prevented of his uÅ¿uall and lamentable concluÅ¿ion, by the teares, and more lamentable concluÅ¿ion of <hi>Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senÅ¿ius,</hi> he cryed out as one halfe undone, <hi>SurripuiÅ¿ti mihi ornamenta Orationis meae.</hi> Is it then any wonder that my conference which was only begun, and Å¿o rather inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, then acted, had not the deÅ¿ired Å¿ucceÅ¿Å¿e? yet I dare Å¿ay that cenÅ¿ure which <hi>EraÅ¿mus</hi> paÅ¿t upon that confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betwixt <hi>S.

I Å¿hewed that there was a great difference between their caÅ¿e and ours in two particulars; firÅ¿t, The things where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>about they did differ, (namely eating or not eating of things Å¿acrificed unto Idolls) were meerely indifferent, not only in their owne nature, but even for uÅ¿e; it being
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:14382:68"/>free and arbitrary unto them to eate or not to eate, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aÅ¿much as there was no law either to command, or to forbid the uÅ¿e of theÅ¿e meates; And therefore the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving Romanes, and the Corinthians not onely might, but alÅ¿o ought, Å¿ometimes to abÅ¿taine from Å¿uch meates, for the avoyding of Å¿candall. But it is not Å¿o with our Ceremonies, albeit they be indifferent in their owne na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as neither being particularly commanded, nor for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden in <hi>Scripture:</hi> yet they are not now indifferent unto us, for the uÅ¿e, nor left unto our choyce, the obÅ¿er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of them being injoyned by lawfull authoritie, (and that the MagiÅ¿trate hath power to make Lawes in things indifferent none will deny but an AnabaptiÅ¿t) And therefore now, though never Å¿o many Å¿hould bee offended at our Ceremonies, yet we can not forbeare to uÅ¿e them without a greater Å¿candall in open diÅ¿obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to lawfull authority. Before that ApoÅ¿tolicall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿titution, <hi>Act.</hi> XV. It was lawfull for a man either to eate, or not to eate things Å¿acrificed unto Idolls, as hee found in his conÅ¿cience moÅ¿t expedient for aedification, there being no law divine, or humane, to rule his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿cience, but only the Iudgement of his owne minde and the generall law of charitie: But after that conÅ¿titution was made, It was not lawfull for him to eate, though in the preÅ¿ence of converted Gentiles, who would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps bee offended at his forbearance; becauÅ¿e now though the matter bee indifferent in its owne nature yet it was not free and arbitrary for uÅ¿e, at leÅ¿t to thoÅ¿e <hi>Churches,</hi> for whom the conÅ¿titution was made, of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch, Syria,</hi> and <hi>Cilicia:</hi> for it Å¿eemes that the eating of things Å¿acrificed to Idolls, was in Å¿ome Å¿ort permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Corinth,</hi> if no man did challenge it.

<pb n="120" facs="tcp:14382:69"/>liberty, in things indifferent, were weake brethren, as Å¿hall appeare in all the places alleadged by the DiÅ¿pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, <hi>Rom.</hi> XIV. 1. <hi>Him that is weake in the faith receive unto you,</hi> v. 2. <hi>One believeth that he may eate of all things; And another which is weake eateth herbes.</hi> Whereupon followes immediatly, <hi>Let not him that eateth, despiÅ¿e him that eateth not.</hi> Chap.

They were weake as being newly converted unto the faith, &amp; as yet neither having meanes, nor leiÅ¿ure, to be fully in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tructed in their ChriÅ¿tian libertie, and therefore much was to be yeilded unto them, leÅ¿t comming newly from IudaiÅ¿me, where they had learned to be zealous of the Law of <hi>MoÅ¿es,</hi> if they Å¿hould Å¿ee ChriÅ¿tians not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿erve that Law, they might be offended at the ChriÅ¿tian Religion. And withall it is to be praeÅ¿umed, that thoÅ¿e to whom the ApoÅ¿tle graunts Å¿uch Indulgence, were willing to be inÅ¿tructed in the right way. But thoÅ¿e who take offence at our Ceremonies, are not now to be eÅ¿teemed weake: They thinke themÅ¿elves the onely il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luminates, even the very <hi>Gnostiques</hi> of this age, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariÅ¿on of whom, all others, who are not of their facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on are very <hi>Ignaroes,</hi> whoÅ¿e minds the god of the world hath Å¿o blinded, that they are deÅ¿titute of heavenly knowledge. BeÅ¿ides, they have had a large time allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them, to informe their conÅ¿ciences, and all meanes have been uÅ¿ed to give them Å¿atisfaction. <hi>But a foole deÅ¿piÅ¿eth his fathers InÅ¿truction. Prov.</hi> XV. 5. And why? <hi>The way of a foole is right in his owne eyes. Prov.</hi> XII. 15. So that thoÅ¿e brethren, whom the ApoÅ¿tle would not have others to offend, in the uÅ¿e of their ChriÅ¿tian liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in things indifferent, were only weake; Ours are wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full; They timorous, Ours obÅ¿tinate; Their offence pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded from Å¿imple ignorance, ariÅ¿ing from the want of
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:14382:69"/>time, and meanes of InÅ¿truction; But the offence which our men take at the Ceremonies, proceedes from affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted error, from pride, prejudice, Å¿ingularity, and the Å¿pirit of malice and contention. And therefore I dare Å¿ay, that albeit his MajeÅ¿ty, and all that are in authority over us, would diÅ¿penÅ¿e with the preÅ¿ent Lawes, and leave it to our owne choyce, whether to uÅ¿e, or not to uÅ¿e the Ceremonies, for feare of giving them offence: Yet were we bound in conÅ¿cience not to yeeld unto them in one jot by our forbearance, in regard that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we Å¿hould but bolÅ¿ter them in their error, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme them in their obÅ¿tinacy and oppoÅ¿ition againÅ¿t the <hi>Church.</hi> I am Å¿ure this was the practice of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poÅ¿tles; At firÅ¿t they yeelded much to the weakneÅ¿Å¿e of IewiÅ¿h Converts, doing and forbearing many things, to avoyd their offence: But when they did pertinaciouÅ¿ly perÅ¿iÅ¿t in their error, calling our ChriÅ¿tian liberty in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tion, the ApoÅ¿tles reÅ¿olutely maintayned it, not regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding their offence at all. So S. <hi>Paul</hi> who circumciÅ¿ed <hi>Timothie,</hi> to avoyd the offence of the weake Iewes, would not circumciÅ¿e <hi>Titus,</hi> to pleaÅ¿e others who were perverÅ¿e deÅ¿piÅ¿ers of our libertie; And he who did pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie himÅ¿elfe to gaine a good opinion of the weake Iewes who were zealous of the Law;

As hee would not yeeld to any thing to diÅ¿pleaÅ¿e thoÅ¿e who were wilfull deÅ¿piÅ¿ers of our liberty, no more Å¿hould we to pleaÅ¿e thoÅ¿e men, who are reÅ¿olved never to be Å¿a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied. I am Å¿ure the tendereÅ¿t hearted man amongÅ¿t them, will not forbeare the eating of a fat Capon upon
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:14382:70"/>Good-Friday, for feare of offending a PapiÅ¿t. And why Å¿hould we forbeare either Surplis, CroÅ¿Å¿e, or Kneeling, becauÅ¿e they are offended at it.</p>
            <p>In theÅ¿e two particulars I Å¿hewed in the Court, the difference between the things whereof the ApoÅ¿tle Å¿peaketh, and our Ceremonies, Å¿o plainly, that it was thought Å¿ufficient to Å¿atisfie any, but thoÅ¿e in whom af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection &amp; partiality have put out the eye of reaÅ¿on. And upon theÅ¿e two caÅ¿es I dare now venture the cauÅ¿e. firÅ¿t, that we are no-where commanded to forbeare the uÅ¿e of a thing indifferent, even where we are left to our owne choyce, for feare of offending the willfull deÅ¿piÅ¿ers of our libertie; but only to avoyd the offence of weak bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, who are willing to learne the right way, &amp; have not had leyÅ¿ure and meanes to be informed. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that if the MagiÅ¿trate interpoÅ¿e his authoritie, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding the uÅ¿e of a thing in it Å¿elfe indifferent; wee are not to forbeare the doing of it, for feare of offending any whatÅ¿oever they be, whether wilfull, or only weak. And that it is Å¿o, Å¿hal appeare unto him who reades theÅ¿e two Chapters, whereunto the DiÅ¿puter did appeale, &amp; Å¿tudies not the Å¿yllables, but the Å¿enÅ¿e of them. And to make this Å¿ame yet more manifeÅ¿t, I will recommend unto the Reader that is deÅ¿irous of Å¿atisfaction, theÅ¿e conÅ¿iderations following. I. When the ApoÅ¿tle char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth us to avoyd the offence of our weake brother, he gives this reaÅ¿on, that we Å¿hould not pleaÅ¿e ourÅ¿elves, but our <hi>neighbour to aedification, Rom. XV.</hi> 1.2. Whereby it is evident, that he Å¿peakes only of theÅ¿e things which are not commanded, but left to our own liberty to doe or not to doe, in which caÅ¿e he wil have us to pleaÅ¿e our neighbour, if he be a weake brother, rather then our Å¿elves: But if the MagiÅ¿trate have interpoÅ¿ed his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement in a thing indifferent, then as we can not forbeare it to pleaÅ¿e our neighbour, if he be a weake brother; Å¿o wee doe it not to pleaÅ¿e our
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:14382:70"/>Å¿elves, but to pleaÅ¿e him, whom <hi>God</hi> hath co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>manded us to obey, not only for wrath, but for conÅ¿cience Å¿ake. II. A thing in it Å¿elfe indifferent, being injoyned by law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full authority, becommeth neceÅ¿Å¿ary unto us for the uÅ¿e; So the ApoÅ¿tles Å¿peaking of things in themÅ¿elves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different, as abÅ¿tinence from meates offered to Idols &amp;c. When once they had made a conÅ¿titution touching them, call them <hi>NeceÅ¿Å¿arie things Act.</hi> XV. 28. And the ApoÅ¿tle Å¿ayes <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>.
<note place="margin">Rom. XIII. 5.</note> It is neceÅ¿Å¿ary that you bee Å¿ubject. And Å¿urely there is nothing wherein wee can Å¿hew our obedience unto the MagiÅ¿trates au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, but only in things indifferent, which <hi>God</hi> hath left in our power: for, thoÅ¿e things which <hi>God</hi> hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, wee muÅ¿t doe, whether the MagiÅ¿trate com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand them or no, yea albeit hee Å¿hould forbid them: And thoÅ¿e things which <hi>God</hi> hath forbidden, wee muÅ¿t not doe, whether the MagiÅ¿trate forbid them or no, yea albeit hee Å¿hould command them: Å¿o that there is no Å¿cope left, either unto the MagiÅ¿trate to command, or unto us to obey, but only in things indifferent. III. If wee Å¿hould not obey the MagiÅ¿trate in a thing indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, when Å¿ome men take offence at it; then we Å¿hall never obey him at all, there Å¿hall be no order, no conÅ¿ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution; for there can be no publicke action, order, or conÅ¿titution, which Å¿ome men will not diÅ¿like. IV. Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the MagiÅ¿trate is a greater duty then the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ing of a private perÅ¿on, and conÅ¿equently the evill of diÅ¿obedience, greater then the evill of Å¿candall. V. If our obedience to the MagiÅ¿trate in a thing indifferent, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend any, the evill is not in us, but in him who is Å¿can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalized: for as <hi>Tertullian</hi> Å¿aith, <hi>Res bona neminem offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, niÅ¿i malam mentem.</hi> It is <hi>Å¿candalum acceptum,</hi> not <hi>da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,</hi> he ought not to be offended, being bound to obey the MagiÅ¿trate as well as we: now were it not a Å¿trange, if I Å¿hould forbeare to doe my duty, becauÅ¿e another man is reÅ¿olved not to doe his. VI. As it is a Å¿inne to diÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obey
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:14382:71"/>lawfull authority, and no Å¿inne in us, if another bee offended at our obedience: Å¿o there is farre greater dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, both to our Å¿elves and to all the whole <hi>Church,</hi> in diÅ¿obedience, then can be in the offence of a few bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren. LaÅ¿tly, If wee refuÅ¿e thoÅ¿e things that are injoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, we cannot avoyd diÅ¿obedience; But if we obÅ¿erve them, we may prevent or remove the offence that is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken at them, by informing the people aright, that they are things in themÅ¿elves indifferent whereunto ChriÅ¿ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an liberty doth extend, and that the MagiÅ¿trate ough<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

If Å¿o much paynes had beene taken to teach them obedience to lawfull authority, the Å¿candall might have beene re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved long erenow. WhoÅ¿oever will be pleaÅ¿ed to conÅ¿ider theÅ¿e particulars Å¿hall finde, that what the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poÅ¿tle hath Å¿poken of ChriÅ¿tian liberty, &amp; of giving of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, makes nothing againÅ¿t our Ceremonies, but eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry way for them. BeÅ¿ides thoÅ¿e two differences which I have obÅ¿erved, betweene their caÅ¿e of whom the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poÅ¿tle Å¿peakes, and ours: It were eaÅ¿ie to Å¿hew many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things, wherein they are moÅ¿t unlike; namely the eating and not eating of meates, are private actions, in a mans owne power to doe or not to doe: But our caÅ¿e is concerning the publicke Ceremonies of the <hi>Church,</hi> which no private man can diÅ¿penÅ¿e with. The ApoÅ¿tle by forbearing fleÅ¿h did prejudice none but himÅ¿elfe: But wee in refuÅ¿ing the Ceremonies Å¿hould prejudice the authority of the Prince. The ApoÅ¿tles for bearance
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:14382:71"/>did further the courÅ¿e of his miniÅ¿tery, and therefore he became all unto-all; But our refuÅ¿all of the Ceremonies Å¿hould looÅ¿e us the liberty of ours, and that moÅ¿t juÅ¿tly for our diÅ¿obedience. Finally, amongÅ¿t the Romanes Å¿ome were offended at the eating of thoÅ¿e meates, but I doe not reade that any was offended at the not eating of them: It is otherwayes with us, where one is offended at our Ceremonies, ten wiÅ¿er then they would be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended if we did not uÅ¿e them; And farre more if we did follow their faÅ¿hion in the manner of Gods wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿hip.</p>
            <p>The caÅ¿e being cleere, that the Orders which our <hi>Church</hi> injoynes, are neyther contrary to ChriÅ¿tian liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, nor to that care wee Å¿hould have for to avoyd of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence; In the next place I will labour to finde out the cauÅ¿e of this groÅ¿Å¿e miÅ¿take in the brethren, which cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely is this, that they doe not rightly conÅ¿ider the nature of ChriÅ¿tian liberty, whilÅ¿t they Å¿et it upon ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-hookes, and Å¿tretch it further then the nature there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of will beare; Å¿eeking not only a liberty of minde and conÅ¿cience in things indifferent, but a freedome alÅ¿o in their outward actions, which is not ChriÅ¿tian libertie,
<note place="margin">Calv. InÅ¿t. lib. III. cap. 19. Sect. 10.</note> but licentious immunity, contrary to the doctrine of the GoÅ¿pell: for <hi>S. Peter</hi> exhorting all men to be obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent unto MagiÅ¿trates,
<note place="margin">I. Pet. II. 16.</note> he warnes them not to <hi>uÅ¿e their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie as a cloake of maliciouÅ¿neÅ¿Å¿e,</hi> Namely, In caÅ¿ting off the bridle of governement. It is proper to the libertie of the Creator alone to be unlimited; but all lawfull li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie of the creature, is and muÅ¿t be bounded, not onely by the Law of charitie, (which theÅ¿e men will acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge) but alÅ¿o by the law of loyaltie; for if all reÅ¿traint of the outward man were contrary to ChriÅ¿tian liberty; then were it not lawfull to obey the MagiÅ¿trate in any thing; Then if the King Å¿hould be pleaÅ¿ed to confirme the Orders, (or as they terme them the circumÅ¿tances of worÅ¿hip) which have beene uÅ¿ed in their congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:14382:72"/>They were bound to forÅ¿ake them, for the zeale of their ChriÅ¿tian libertie. And what is this elÅ¿e, but to bring flat AnabaptiÅ¿me and <hi>Anarchie</hi> into the <hi>Church,</hi> to overthrow all Governement, and diÅ¿Å¿olve the bonds of Å¿ubjection and obedience to lawfull authority. You Å¿hall therefore underÅ¿tand, that the MagiÅ¿trate by his Lawes may moderate or reÅ¿traine the outward actions, wherein the externall uÅ¿e of our liberty conÅ¿iÅ¿teth; The inward liberty of conÅ¿cience before <hi>God,</hi> notwithÅ¿tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding remayning intyre. He may injoyne any action which in <hi>Gods</hi> worÅ¿hip may be uÅ¿ed lawfully; So that no opinion be put upon the conÅ¿cience, which taketh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the full reÅ¿pect of its indifferency. And this is that which <hi>S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Peter</hi> Å¿ayes; We muÅ¿t obey the MagiÅ¿trates, <hi>as free,</hi> that is, as being perÅ¿waded that the thing com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded in it Å¿elfe, and to God-ward (as <hi>Calvin</hi> Å¿peakes) is indifferent, and whether we doe it, or not doe it, in it Å¿elfe it commends us not unto <hi>God,</hi> otherwiÅ¿e then that by obeying of the MagiÅ¿trate, we doe alÅ¿o obey <hi>God,</hi> who hath commanded us to be Å¿ubject unto him. Which will better appeare if we conÅ¿ider that ChriÅ¿ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an liberty is inward and Å¿pirituall, which may Å¿tand with the outward Å¿ervitude of Å¿laves (as the ApoÅ¿tle Å¿hewes. I. <hi>Cor.</hi> VII. 22.) much more with the obedience of free Å¿ubjects: It is Å¿eated in the minde and conÅ¿cience, and reÅ¿pecteth nothing, but what is betweene <hi>God</hi> and us: It contenteth it Å¿elfe, if there be no opinion put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the conÅ¿cience of the neceÅ¿Å¿ity of theÅ¿e things, which <hi>God</hi> hath left indifferent: if they be not obtruded as di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Lawes: if no Religion be plac't in them, nor they preÅ¿Å¿ed as immediate parts of <hi>Gods</hi> worÅ¿hip. It is only the Å¿ubjecting of the conÅ¿cience unto a thing indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent,
<note place="margin">I. Cor. VI. 12.</note> (which the ApoÅ¿tle calls, <hi>The bringing us under the power of a thing</hi>) which overthrowes our ChriÅ¿tian li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty: not the neceÅ¿Å¿ity of obedience unto lawfull au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority; but the doctrine or opinion of the abÅ¿olute ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceÅ¿Å¿ity

In a word ChriÅ¿tian libertie is not taken away by the neceÅ¿Å¿ity of doing a thing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different, or not doing; but only by that neceÅ¿Å¿ity which taketh away the opinion or perÅ¿waÅ¿ion of the indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency of it: As may appeare by this, whenÅ¿oever the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poÅ¿tle condemnes the practiÅ¿e of IewiÅ¿h Geremonies, at that time when there was Å¿ome diÅ¿penÅ¿ation and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence granted unto ChriÅ¿tians, till the Synagogue Å¿hould be buried with honour; It is manifeÅ¿t that he condemnes not Å¿o much the uÅ¿e, as the doctrine and opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion which they had of them; becauÅ¿e they were urged and uÅ¿ed, not as things indifferent, but as neceÅ¿Å¿ary unto Å¿alvation. For we know that he himÅ¿elfe many times did uÅ¿e them, which he would not have done, if they had beene then Å¿implie evill: he circumciÅ¿ed <hi>Timothie;</hi> and many ChriÅ¿tians who gave their lives for the TeÅ¿ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of <hi>IeÅ¿us Christ,</hi> were circumciÅ¿ed at that time, even after their converÅ¿ion unto the faith; And yet when the falÅ¿e ApoÅ¿tles did urge the neceÅ¿Å¿ity of CircumciÅ¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he Å¿aid, <hi>If ye be circumciÅ¿ed, ChriÅ¿t Å¿hall profit you nothing, Gal.</hi> V. 2, That is, If you bee circumciÅ¿ed with an opinion of the neceÅ¿Å¿ity of that Ceremony, as if it did avayle unto juÅ¿tification, Å¿o he expounds himÅ¿elfe, ver. 4. <hi>WhoÅ¿oever are juÅ¿tified by the Law,</hi> (that is, Å¿eeke for IuÅ¿tification by the Law) <hi>are fallen from Grace.</hi> That it was only the doctrine &amp; opinion they had of Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciÅ¿ion at that time, which he condemnes, may appeare further by this, that thoÅ¿e Ceremonies were not prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿cribed by a Civill MagiÅ¿trate, who hath power to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund the outward man in the uÅ¿e of a thing indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, but only by Å¿educing teachers, who had no power of bringing a neceÅ¿Å¿ity in the outward practiÅ¿e, but by perÅ¿wading and poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿ing mens mindes with an opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the neceÅ¿Å¿ity of theÅ¿e things, After the like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner doth the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> at this day tyrannize over the conÅ¿ciences of men, equalling her conÅ¿titutions un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

But our <hi>Church</hi> is farre from Å¿uch an uÅ¿urpation, Å¿he doth place no Religion in them, aÅ¿cribe no holyneÅ¿Å¿e unto them, nor obtrude them upon the conÅ¿cience as things neceÅ¿Å¿ary in themÅ¿elves, like <hi>Gods</hi> Commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: but only requires obedience unto her conÅ¿titu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, thereby to reduce all her Children to an orderly Uniformity in the outward worÅ¿hip of <hi>God,</hi> And to this purpoÅ¿e Å¿he hath Å¿ufficiently declared the innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of her meaning, in the Articles of Religion, <hi>Artic.</hi> XX. <hi>The Church ought not to enforce any thing beÅ¿ides the holy Writ to be beleeved of neceÅ¿Å¿ity for Å¿alvation:</hi> And in the <hi>Pre face</hi> before the Booke of Common Prayer, <hi>The Ceremonies that remaine, are retayned for a diÅ¿cipline and order, which (upon just cauÅ¿es) may bee altered and changed, and therefore are not to bee eÅ¿teemed equall with Gods Law.</hi> So that I can not but wonder at the impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencie of the Libeller, who changes our <hi>Church,</hi> as <hi>Christ</hi> doth the PhariÅ¿ees, that Å¿he makes the commandements of <hi>God</hi> of none effect by her traditions: Whereas the PhariÅ¿ees did equall and preferre, their owne traditions unto the commandements of <hi>God,</hi> which is the thing for which they are condemned, as Å¿hall appeare unto any that reades the Text: But our <hi>Church</hi> is farre from Å¿uch preÅ¿umption, as may appeare by her doctrine pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliÅ¿hed, which I have alleadged, as alÅ¿o by that which followeth in the Å¿ame preface. <hi>In theÅ¿e our doings wee condemne no other nations, nor preÅ¿cribe any thing but to our owne people only. For we thinke it convenient, that every Countrey Å¿hould uÅ¿e Å¿uch Ceremonies, as they Å¿hall thinke best to the Å¿etting forth of Gods honour and glory, and to the reducing of the people to a moÅ¿t perfect and godly living without error or Å¿uperÅ¿tition.</hi> Now I have proved in my Sermon by Arguments unanÅ¿werable, that the <hi>Church</hi> hath Å¿uch a power, to ordaine Ceremonies, and to make
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:14382:73"/>Lawes of things indifferent, <hi>for decencie and orders Å¿ake;</hi> And that obedience ought to be given unto her conÅ¿ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions; EÅ¿pecially conÅ¿idering that therein our <hi>Church</hi> was not only aÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿ted, but authorized by the Kings moÅ¿t excellent MajeÅ¿ty, as the Å¿upreme Governor upon Earth, In all cauÅ¿es within his highneÅ¿Å¿e dominions. And therefore I Å¿hall intreat my good brethren, if they will neyther deceive others, nor be deceived themÅ¿elves, that in this point of ChriÅ¿tian liberty, they would have alwayes one eye fixed upon the nature of things indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent, and the other upon the duty of a Å¿ubject to his Soveraigne.</p>
            <p>And now having vindicated our <hi>Church</hi> from thoÅ¿e aÅ¿perÅ¿ions caÅ¿t upon her of infringing ChriÅ¿tian liberty, and giving offence by her conÅ¿titutions: I will in the laÅ¿t place, turne the DiÅ¿puters weapon againÅ¿t himÅ¿elfe, and cut off the head of that PhiliÅ¿tine with his owne Å¿word; Å¿hewing that he and his fellowes, of all others are moÅ¿t injurious unto ChriÅ¿tian liberty,

In this Conflict, I confeÅ¿Å¿e, my AnÅ¿wers were very briefe, denying only that Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ition which was falÅ¿e, &amp; Å¿ometimes giving inÅ¿tance to Å¿how the abÅ¿urdity thereof: Intending to let the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿puter runne his witts out of breath, and then (if I had not been prevented by being put in mind of the danger of that publick diÅ¿putation) to reÅ¿ume the Å¿umme of his proofes, &amp; make the Auditors Å¿enÅ¿ible of the vanity of them. In the mean time I was forc'd to follow, or rather goe along with him in his wyld-gooÅ¿e-chaÅ¿e, through a rabble of intortuled SyllogiÅ¿mes, which to relate I Å¿hould even bluÅ¿h in his behalfe; And indeed the third part of them that are Å¿et downe in the Libell, were not uÅ¿ed in the Court, but have been framed Å¿ince by the Libeller, as are alÅ¿o the AnÅ¿wers fathered upon

And beÅ¿ides his bold alleadg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the example of <hi>Christs</hi> InÅ¿titution (whereof I will Å¿ay nothing now,

That it hath an appearance of Idolatry and will-worÅ¿hip. IV.

            <p>The firÅ¿t exception againÅ¿t Kneeling is, <hi>That it hath beene abuÅ¿ed to Idolatry.</hi> What then? If that were a Å¿ure rule, that all things which have been Å¿o abuÅ¿ed, Å¿hould be aboliÅ¿hed, we Å¿hould leave our Å¿elves nothing which could be Å¿afely uÅ¿ed: for there is none either of all <hi>Gods</hi> workes, or of the workes of man, but it hath in Å¿ome place or other, been Å¿ome way or other abuÅ¿ed to Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry. How then could our conÅ¿ciences be aÅ¿Å¿ured of the lawfull uÅ¿e of any thing which we uÅ¿e, whenas we are not Å¿ure, whether the Å¿ame thing in Å¿ome other place be not made an Idoll?

            </p>
            <p>It is true indeed, that in the firÅ¿t Councell of <hi>Nice,</hi> there is a decree for Å¿tanding at prayer on the <hi>Lords</hi> dayes; But that was an exception from the generall rule of worÅ¿hip, upon a Å¿peciall occaÅ¿ion, which did not extend unto all ordinances, as may appeare by the end why it was ordayned, namely to confirme their <hi>Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chumeni</hi> in the faith of <hi>Christs</hi> reÅ¿urrection. Therefore howÅ¿oever they did Å¿tand at prayer, during that Å¿ervice, which was called <hi>MiÅ¿Å¿a Catechumenorum;</hi> yet not at the other, which was called <hi>MiÅ¿Å¿a fidelium,</hi> wherein they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the Sacrament, their Novices being diÅ¿miÅ¿Å¿ed. And Å¿urely it is abÅ¿urd to think, that becauÅ¿e they Å¿tood at prayer, therefore they Å¿tood at the Sacrament; for their Å¿tanding was uÅ¿ed for commemoration of <hi>Christs</hi> reÅ¿urrection, but the Sacrament is ordayned for the commemoration of his death. Now, as the one requires a geÅ¿ture to expreÅ¿Å¿e confidence, Å¿o the other requires a geÅ¿ture to expreÅ¿Å¿e humilitie. But if I Å¿hould graunt, (which is moÅ¿t falÅ¿e) that when they did pray Å¿tand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, they did receive Å¿tanding; yet that was only on the <hi>Lords</hi> dayes, and on the feaÅ¿t of PentecoÅ¿t, &amp; we know that they did frequently aÅ¿Å¿emble and receive the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament on the weeke dayes: BeÅ¿ides before the decree of the Councell of <hi>Nice,</hi> for above 300. yeares, kneeling was in common practiÅ¿e in <hi>Gods</hi> worÅ¿hip, as the Canon it Å¿elfe declareth, and as it was uÅ¿ed in prayer, Å¿o in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving of the Sacrament.</p>

            <p>If any man Å¿hall aske me, When Kneeling began to be uÅ¿ed by Communicants, Å¿eeing <hi>ChriÅ¿t</hi> did inÅ¿titute the Sacrament in another geÅ¿ture: I Å¿ay, that I hold S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>AuÅ¿tins</hi> rule to be moÅ¿t certaine, that <hi>whatÅ¿oever the Church hath obÅ¿erved generally in all places, at all times, and was not decreed by any Generall Councell, the Å¿ame did proceede from the ApoÅ¿tles:</hi> But Å¿uch is kneeling at the Communion, It hath been uÅ¿ed in all places, at all times, and was not decreed by any Generall Councell; and therefore did proceed from the ApoÅ¿tles. As after <hi>Christs</hi> reÅ¿urrection, his DiÅ¿ciples prayed unto him kneeling, which they uÅ¿ed not to do before; Å¿o it is more then likely that they received the Sacrament kneeling, the Å¿ame being a reall prayer &amp; thankÅ¿giving, and the higheÅ¿t part of <hi>Gods</hi> outward worÅ¿hip. If the geÅ¿ture which <hi>ChriÅ¿t</hi> uÅ¿ed with his DiÅ¿ciples, was <hi>Accubitus,</hi> lying: It was certainely occaÅ¿ioned by the conjunction of another meale, which did require an eaÅ¿ie repoÅ¿e of the body; But when the other meale was removed, &amp; the Sacrament celebrate apart, there was no more uÅ¿e of that geÅ¿ture, but the fitteÅ¿t geÅ¿ture for the Sacrament was that; which is accounted moÅ¿t decent &amp; reverent in <hi>Gods</hi> worÅ¿hip.

I will now proceed further, and Å¿hew that it is not Å¿o much as of the Å¿ame kind with theirs, being di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tinguiÅ¿hed from it by two or three Å¿ubÅ¿tantiall diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences. The firÅ¿t is taken from the Agents, their knee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling is the geÅ¿ture of PapiÅ¿ts, ours of Catholickes: Now if PapiÅ¿ts and ProteÅ¿tants be two diverÅ¿e kinds of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿hippers; (which I thinke the brethren will acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge) then their actions of worÅ¿hip, muÅ¿t be as diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent in kind, as be their Agents.

            <p>I thought I had Å¿ufficiently taken away the firÅ¿t ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, <hi>That kneeling at the Sacrament hath beene abuÅ¿ed to Idolatry,</hi> by Å¿hewing that all things Å¿o abuÅ¿ed are not to be aboliÅ¿hed, albeit the inventions of man; That kneeling is no invention of man, And that our kneeling neither was nor is abuÅ¿ed to Idolatry: But peruÅ¿ing the Libell againe, I find Å¿ome Scripture alleadged by the DiÅ¿puter to prove his aÅ¿Å¿ertion, with as much fidelity, as the devill did alleadge Scripture in the GoÅ¿pell. Yet I will Å¿tay to examine it. The place is <hi>Deuter.</hi> XII. 4. <hi>Yee Å¿hall not doe Å¿o unto the Lord your God,</hi> and ver. 30.31.

<pb n="147" facs="tcp:14382:82"/>that in the word of <hi>God,</hi> without relation to any Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleÅ¿iaÅ¿ticall conÅ¿titution, there is as much warrant for kneeling at the Sacrament, as for Å¿itting, Å¿tanding, or any other geÅ¿ture, and more for kneeling then for either of them, the Å¿ame being more Å¿utable unto worÅ¿hippers: And that now the <hi>Church,</hi> (according to that liberty which <hi>God</hi> hath allowed her to determine Å¿uch cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumÅ¿tances) having ordayned that geÅ¿ture, we have not only a warrant, but alÅ¿o a neceÅ¿Å¿ity: laid upon us to obÅ¿erve it; foraÅ¿much as it is neceÅ¿Å¿ary to obey authority, neceÅ¿Å¿ary to maintaine the Peace of the <hi>Church,</hi> neceÅ¿Å¿ary to preÅ¿erve the liberty of our mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niÅ¿teries, neceÅ¿Å¿ary to receive the holy Sacrament: And as the caÅ¿e Å¿tands, unleÅ¿Å¿e wee kneele, we diÅ¿obey authority, diÅ¿turbe the <hi>Churches</hi> peace, loÅ¿e the liberty of our miniÅ¿tery, and the comfort of the Sacrament. Let us Å¿ee then whether kneeling at the Sacrament, come within the compaÅ¿Å¿e of that prohibition, <hi>ye Å¿hall not doe Å¿o unto the Lord your God,</hi> namely as the nations did.

I. Their Idols and Images of their gods, which muÅ¿t be deÅ¿troyed, <hi>you Å¿hall hew downe the graven Images of their gods, and deÅ¿troy the names of them out of that place:</hi> But what is this to our geÅ¿ture of Knee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling at the Communion?

II. ThoÅ¿e in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿truments and ornaments were the Å¿ame Individualls which were abuÅ¿ed: Å¿o is not our kneeling at the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the Å¿ame with the kneeling of either <hi>Pagan</hi> or <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piÅ¿t,</hi> as I have formerly proved. III. TheÅ¿e inÅ¿truments &amp; ornaments did not firÅ¿t belong unto the Å¿ervice of the true <hi>God,</hi> &amp; were from thence applyed unto the Å¿er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of an Idoll. But were deviÅ¿ed &amp; invented for the Idol-worÅ¿hip; But all geÅ¿tures, &amp; eÅ¿pecially kneeling, did from the beginning belong unto the Å¿ervice of the true <hi>God,</hi> and were from thence transferred from <hi>Gods</hi> worÅ¿hip to Idolatry, by plaine theft, &amp; unjuÅ¿t alienation of his title and intereÅ¿t. Now, can there be an Act more
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:14382:84"/>juÅ¿t, then to give unto <hi>God</hi> that which is <hi>Gods,</hi> reÅ¿toring the geÅ¿ture of kneeling unto the true uÅ¿e, which Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters had Å¿acrilegiouÅ¿ly uÅ¿urped.

               <hi>Nebuchadnezar</hi> defiled the veÅ¿Å¿els of the Temple, &amp; put them in the houÅ¿e of his god; yet the Å¿ame being reÅ¿tored by <hi>Cyrus,</hi> were (not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withÅ¿tanding of the abuÅ¿e) imployed in <hi>Gods</hi> Å¿ervice as before: In like manner, why Å¿hould not kneeling which at firÅ¿t belonged to the Å¿ervice of <hi>God,</hi> though it hath been abuÅ¿ed at the MaÅ¿Å¿e, be thought fit to be uÅ¿ed at the Sacrament. Finally, thoÅ¿e inÅ¿truments &amp; ornaments had no other uÅ¿e but for the honour of the Idoll: But our geÅ¿ture of kneeling, as it is not uÅ¿ed in honour of the PopiÅ¿h MaÅ¿Å¿e, Å¿o it hath a needfull uÅ¿e in <hi>Gods</hi> worÅ¿hip, &amp; in this very ordinance, as after I Å¿hall declare.

Let him now examine all theÅ¿e places, and he Å¿hall find that all which is condemned, is either one of theÅ¿e foure things, which before I mentioned in that place of <hi>Deuteronomie;</hi> or elÅ¿e meates Å¿acrificed unto Idols; (which yet are allowed out of the caÅ¿e of Å¿candal, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.27.) or communion with Idolaters in their falÅ¿e worÅ¿hip: Or making of covenants &amp; leagues of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarity, eÅ¿pecially marriages with them: Or finally, civill uncleanneÅ¿Å¿e, as making of baldneÅ¿Å¿e upon their heads, marring the corners of their beards, uÅ¿ing mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of cattell of diverÅ¿e kindes, and of linnen and woollen in the Å¿ame garment, which did belong unto
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:14382:85"/>the Ceremoniall Law, whereby <hi>Gods</hi> people were Å¿eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from other nations, in many outward obÅ¿ervances: But in all theÅ¿e places, or in any other place of Scripture there is nothing forbidden, which can by the leaÅ¿t Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie be applyed unto our kneeling at the Sacrament, or unto any other geÅ¿ture which we uÅ¿e in any of <hi>Gods</hi> Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances. In a word as the Sunne, Moone, and Starres, which have beene notoriouÅ¿ly abuÅ¿ed to Idolatry, can not be deÅ¿troyed, partly becauÅ¿e they are out of our power, and partly becauÅ¿e they are of durable neceility: Even Å¿o for the Å¿ame reaÅ¿ons, geÅ¿tures which have been abuÅ¿ed, cannot be aboliÅ¿hed, becauÅ¿e Å¿uch geÅ¿tures as have been already abuÅ¿ed by others, are out of our reach; and all geÅ¿tures are of durable neceÅ¿Å¿ity to mankind for ever.</p>
            <p>Now have I made it as cleere as the Sunne, that our kneeling at the Sacrament, is not to bee reckoned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongÅ¿t thoÅ¿e things which have been abuÅ¿ed to Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and therefore is not to be aboliÅ¿hed: But becauÅ¿e they uÅ¿e this Argument againÅ¿t other Ceremonies of our <hi>Church,</hi> I wil looke more neerely into the true mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and intent of that Law, which <hi>God</hi> gave unto his people, for deÅ¿troying the complements of Idolatrous worÅ¿hip, that thereby all men may judge how farre we are bound by that Commandement, to aboliÅ¿h things which have beene IdolatrouÅ¿ly abuÅ¿ed. And I find it moÅ¿t evident, that the Å¿trictneÅ¿Å¿e of that Law in reÅ¿pect of many things which were to be deÅ¿troyed, concerned the Iewes only, as may appeare by theÅ¿e conÅ¿iderations following.

<pb n="162" facs="tcp:14382:90"/>firÅ¿t to <hi>Gods</hi> Å¿ervice, before it was applyed to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny idolatrous worÅ¿hip: BeÅ¿ides it was never the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of worÅ¿hip, as was the Image of an oxe, but the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ture which alwayes was, and ever will be common to true worÅ¿hippers and falÅ¿e. Next, if our kneeling at the Sacrament, be an occaÅ¿ion of Idolatry; Then Å¿o is their Å¿itting bare, which they uÅ¿e not to doe in the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciÅ¿e of the Word: And why may not the people, percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving them to give more reverence to the Sacrament, then to the Word, take occaÅ¿ion from thence to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿hip it, as well as from our kneeling: for uncovering of the head is an expreÅ¿Å¿ion of worÅ¿hip, as well as knee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and (as I proved before) A man may commit Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry fitting. Againe, the error of the minde is the true occaÅ¿ion of Idolatry, and not kneeling; If in time of our publick prayer, Å¿ome Å¿uperÅ¿titious perÅ¿ons kneele, with Å¿ecret reference to Saints departed (as they may doe) will any man affirme that their kneeling is the occaÅ¿ion of their Idolatry, and not rather their minds, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing leavened with Å¿uperÅ¿tition, makes them uÅ¿e that ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ture accordingly? So, it is not the PapiÅ¿ts kneeling, but their erroneous doctrine that is the occaÅ¿ion of their Idolatry: firÅ¿t, the falÅ¿e doctrine of the Sacrament corrupted their minds, and their minds becoming I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatrous, made their kneeling Å¿uch. Now the doctrine of our <hi>Church</hi> concerning the Sacrament is Å¿ound, and doth Å¿ufficiently acquit us from giving any occaÅ¿ion of Idolatry; and doctrine is it which in all Religions de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termines the end and uÅ¿e of all geÅ¿tures.

This is to abÅ¿taine from all appearance of evill, or (as the word beares) all evill appearance. And would to <hi>God</hi> that theÅ¿e mens diÅ¿ciples had followed this adviÅ¿e, then Å¿hould they not have beene Å¿o much infected with the poyÅ¿on of their doctrine. II. The appearance of evill which we are to abÅ¿taine from is not in reÅ¿pect of others, but in reÅ¿pect of our Å¿elves; We Å¿hould abÅ¿taine from that which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares to us, after due tryall and examination to be evill<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> for it is every man himÅ¿elfe that is to prove all things, that is all doctrines, and not others for him: And he is to keepe that which is good; not that which appeares good unto others; But that which he himÅ¿elfe, after tryall evidently finds to be good: And Å¿o he is to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿taine from that which after tryall appeares evill unto himÅ¿elfe, whatÅ¿oever it appeare unto others. And Å¿o this is all one with that which the ApoÅ¿tle requires <hi>Rom.</hi> XIV. 5. <hi>Let every man be fully perÅ¿waded in his owne mind.</hi> But then if any man Å¿hould apply this rule; to the practiÅ¿e of things indifferent, he muÅ¿t extend it no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, then to thoÅ¿e things, which are in our owne choyce, as not being determined by any conÅ¿titution civill or EccleÅ¿iaÅ¿ticall. III. If the precept be extended unto thoÅ¿e things which appeare evill unto others, then thoÅ¿e <hi>others</hi> are only men of Å¿ound Iudgement, <hi>rectÃ¨ Å¿en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tientes,</hi> to whom nothing Å¿eemes evill but what indeed is evill: And Å¿o nothing is forbidden, but what is evill, (As the <hi>Syriack</hi> expreÅ¿Å¿es it <hi>AbÅ¿tain from all kind of evill, or from every evill thing</hi>) As namely, intire familiarity with wicked perÅ¿ons, and Communion with them in evill, which is not onely an appearance of evill, but evill it Å¿elfe. And Å¿o this precept is all one with that of the
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:14382:92"/>ApoÅ¿tle <hi>Iude,</hi> who borrowing a Metaphor from the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remoniall pollution of the Law, bids us <hi>Hate even that garment which is Å¿potted by the fleÅ¿h</hi> ver. 23. AlÅ¿o the unÅ¿ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿onable practiÅ¿e of holy duties without regard to the circumÅ¿tances of time and place comes within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paÅ¿Å¿e of that prohibition, as for a man to kneele downe and pray in the market place; And for the brethren to keepe their exerciÅ¿es in private conventicles, and at un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿eaÅ¿onable houres: This is not only an appearance of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill, but evill, becauÅ¿e it is contrary to that diÅ¿cretion which <hi>God</hi> requireth, appointing every thing to be done in due Å¿eaÅ¿on, and in lawfull manner. But what is this to kneeling at the Sacrament? It cannot come with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the compaÅ¿Å¿e of the ApoÅ¿tles prohibition: for it is not evill in it Å¿elfe, and it appeares not evil to us, we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fully perÅ¿waded in our conÅ¿cience, both of the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneÅ¿Å¿e and expediency of it; Neither doth it Å¿eeme evill unto any Iudicious men, but only unto humorous fooles, whoÅ¿e heads are crazed in the principles of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derÅ¿tanding; for whoÅ¿e Å¿akes we ought not, nor can not abÅ¿taine from it, conÅ¿idering firÅ¿t that the publicke do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine cleeres our practiÅ¿e, from all evill and appearance of evill: And if it were not for the doctrine of the <hi>Church,</hi> there is no geÅ¿ture we could uÅ¿e in <hi>Gods</hi> wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿hip, but it would carry a Å¿hew, both of heatheniÅ¿h and PopiÅ¿h Idolatry, foraÅ¿much as all geÅ¿tures have beene abuÅ¿ed by them. Againe we have a lawfull calling for to uÅ¿e it, The Commandement of authority; And it is not a Å¿hew of evill in a thing indifferent, that can make it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull to him who hath an honeÅ¿t calling to uÅ¿e it. Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, if we Å¿hould refuÅ¿e this geÅ¿ture for the pretended Å¿hew of evill, what other geÅ¿ture can we uÅ¿e which hath not a greater appearance of evill? If we uÅ¿e Å¿itting, it hath a manifeÅ¿t appearance of unreverence, prophane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿Å¿e, contempt of the holy Sacrament; And refuÅ¿ing to kneele being commanded, hath more then a Å¿hew of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogance,

But for any to refuÅ¿e Å¿o farre, as rather then kneele, to loÅ¿e their miniÅ¿tery, and the comfort of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is not only an appearance, but a pregnant evidence of vile hypocriÅ¿ie, while they Å¿traine at a gnat and Å¿wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low a Camell, refuÅ¿ing the greateÅ¿t good, for avoyding of that, which is but by miÅ¿conÅ¿truction, a Å¿hew of evill, to Å¿ome few people only, whom they themÅ¿elves have deluded. But the DiÅ¿puter will prove our kneeling at the Sacrament to bee an appearance of Idolatry, And how? He tells us <hi>The body goes as farte as it can goe, if it would commit Bread worÅ¿hip</hi> (pardon me good Reader for preÅ¿enting thee Å¿uch non-Å¿enÅ¿e) And againe that <hi>When we kneele, our outward behaviour is as like the Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous kneeler, as can be; Å¿o that none can tell whether we wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿hip God, or the bread.</hi> And that <hi>A MagiÅ¿trate can doe no more (for his heart) when he would Å¿uppreÅ¿Å¿e Idolatry, then curb the outward expreÅ¿Å¿ions of it; for the heart no man can know whether it be committing Idolatry or not, but by the outward acts.</hi> This miÅ¿erable man is Å¿o blinded, that hee is a fitter object of pitty, then Å¿ubject of inÅ¿truction: for hee will not conÅ¿ider, that all geÅ¿tures are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to true worÅ¿hippers and falÅ¿e: That kneeling did firÅ¿t belong unto <hi>Gods</hi> Å¿ervice, and albeit it bee now u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ed by Idolaters by unjuÅ¿t alienation, yet it is fit that we Å¿hould give unto <hi>God</hi> that which is his owne, he having Å¿ayd: <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Æ²</g>nto me every knee Å¿hall bow:</hi> That un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leÅ¿Å¿e we uÅ¿e theÅ¿e geÅ¿tures in the worÅ¿hip of <hi>God,</hi> which are uÅ¿ed by Idolaters, (And Å¿o our behaviour be as like theirs as can be) we Å¿hall uÅ¿e none at all: And take away all geÅ¿tures, then take away the whole outward wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿hip of <hi>God:</hi> That it is not the outward geÅ¿ture which diÅ¿tinguiÅ¿heth betwixt a true worÅ¿hipper, and an Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but their Doctrine and ProfeÅ¿Å¿ion. I will now fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther tell him, that our kneeling at the Sacrament is no liker the <hi>PapiÅ¿ts</hi> kneeling, then their Å¿itting is like
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:14382:93"/>unto the <hi>Popes,</hi> except only that they have not Å¿o great a Å¿hew of <hi>devotion.</hi> And <hi>as a MagiÅ¿trate can doe no more when he would Å¿uppreÅ¿Å¿e Idolatry, then reÅ¿traine the outward act:</hi> So our Kings MajeÅ¿ty, when he would bring theÅ¿e men to an orderly forme in <hi>Gods</hi> worÅ¿hip, he can doe no more but injoyne the outward expreÅ¿Å¿ion thereof by a decent and reverent <hi>kneeling;</hi> hee can not roote out of their harts, unreverence, prophaneneÅ¿Å¿e, arrogancy, pride, praeÅ¿umption, and hypocriÅ¿ie; which are the only true cauÅ¿e of their oppoÅ¿ition. Now as to his other a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿perÅ¿ion, that <hi>kneeling is an appearance of Will-worÅ¿hip.</hi> I Å¿hall need to Å¿ay no more, then I have already, when I treated of ChriÅ¿tian liberty, namely that we doe not place either WorÅ¿hip or Religion in that geÅ¿ture, nor lay any opinion upon the conÅ¿ciences of people of the neceÅ¿Å¿ity thereof: But Å¿uch is his ignorance, that hee can not diÅ¿tinguiÅ¿h between theÅ¿e things, <hi>Quae Å¿pectant ad cultum,</hi> which belong unto the worÅ¿hip of <hi>God,</hi> and wherein it conÅ¿iÅ¿ts; And thoÅ¿e things <hi>Quae conducunt ad cultum,</hi> which only conduce unto <hi>Gods</hi> worÅ¿hip, as the changeable circumÅ¿tances of time and place, and the outward forme and order of AdminiÅ¿tration, of which Å¿ort is our kneeling at the Communion, but a changeable circumÅ¿tance, albeit of all other geÅ¿tures, the moÅ¿t de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent expreÅ¿Å¿ion of worÅ¿hip. And Å¿o not being eÅ¿teemed by us to be worÅ¿hip, it can not be called <hi>Will-worÅ¿hip.</hi> BeÅ¿ides, we have a warrant from the Word, both by precept and preÅ¿ident, to kneele in <hi>Gods</hi> Å¿ervice. But as for them who make Å¿itting neceÅ¿Å¿ary and eÅ¿Å¿entiall unto the Sacrament, as a part of <hi>ChriÅ¿ts</hi> InÅ¿titution, without any warrant from the Word; And who bind the conÅ¿ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of their people by their negative precepts, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuÅ¿e our Ceremonies; I have proved both in my Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, and in this diÅ¿courÅ¿e, that they are guilty of will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worÅ¿hip in the higheÅ¿t degree. So that the DiÅ¿puter al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadged that place <hi>Col.</hi> II. 23. againÅ¿t will worÅ¿hip, in an
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:14382:93"/>ill houre to his owne head: for theÅ¿e men whom the ApoÅ¿tle charges with will worÅ¿hip, did not urge the neceÅ¿Å¿ity of doing any thing which <hi>God</hi> had not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded, but the neceÅ¿Å¿ity of abÅ¿tayning from Å¿ome things, which <hi>God</hi> had not prohibited, as may appeare by the words going before, <hi>Touch not, TaÅ¿te not, Handle not:</hi> So that there may be will-worÅ¿hip, in making con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿cience of abÅ¿tayning from a thing that is indifferent, as if it were in it Å¿elfe unlawfull; as well, as in placing Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion in the obÅ¿ervation of it. This is indeed the bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threns caÅ¿e: They bind the conÅ¿ciences of men under paine of Å¿inne, not to kneele, not to croÅ¿Å¿e, not to weare a Å¿urplice, and in a word not to obÅ¿erve any thing injoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in our <hi>Church:</hi> whereby they are as guilty of will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worÅ¿hip as the falÅ¿e ApoÅ¿tles were; And beÅ¿ides their will-worÅ¿hip, they are guilty of diÅ¿obedience, which the falÅ¿e ApoÅ¿tles were not: for there was no comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement to injoyne <hi>Touching, Tasting, Handling;</hi> But they were things left unto their owne power; whereas our Ceremonies are injoyned by lawfull authority.

                  <p>That which carryes a greater appearance of unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence, prophaneneÅ¿Å¿e, contempt of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, arrogancie, pride, praeÅ¿umption, faction, diÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience &amp; hypocriÅ¿ie; then kneeling doth of Idolatry: Is to be avoyded.</p>

<pb n="170" facs="tcp:14382:94"/>in abÅ¿tayning from things indifferent, albeit commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by lawfull authority, are guilty both of will-wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿hip and diÅ¿obedience:

            <p>I am now come unto the laÅ¿t exception, <hi>That knee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in the Act of receiving is Idolatry.</hi> Here the DiÅ¿pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter doth not Å¿peake, but mutter: he dares not directly charge us with <hi>Idolatry;</hi> (for any thing I can find in the Libell) yet he labours to inÅ¿inuat Å¿o much unto his credulous diÅ¿ciples, giving this as a reaÅ¿on of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuÅ¿ing that geÅ¿ture. <hi>LeÅ¿t it be the inducement or very act of Idolatry.</hi> Which is, (as I obÅ¿erved before) <hi>SuperÅ¿titi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oÅ¿a timiditas, A feare where no feare is.</hi> Againe he tells us, That <hi>Christ uÅ¿ed not kneeling</hi> (namely in the InÅ¿titu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Sacrament) <hi>to prevent all Idolatry.</hi> This is a bold, yea an impudent aÅ¿Å¿ertion: for hee knowes not what geÅ¿ture <hi>ChriÅ¿t</hi> uÅ¿ed; Neither doth it appeare un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us, that <hi>ChriÅ¿t</hi> himÅ¿elfe did receive the Sacrament; But that he miniÅ¿tred the Å¿ame unto his diÅ¿ciples: And if they did not kneele, it was not upon that ground, to prevent Idolatry; But, (as I have manifeÅ¿ted in my Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon) becauÅ¿e this Sacrament was celebrated with the conjunction of another meale, which did require a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ture of eaÅ¿e: And becauÅ¿e he did in a manner conceale the glory of his God head, till after his reÅ¿urrection, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿omuch that in the dayes of his fleÅ¿h, his DiÅ¿ciples did not in their ordinary prayers kneele unto him as the object of joynt adoration. BeÅ¿ides, the forbearing of this geÅ¿ture cannot prevent Idolatry; for I have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly proved, that a man may commit Idolatry Å¿itting as well as kneeling. But here the DiÅ¿puter tells us, <hi>A man cannot commit [Bodily Idolatry] Å¿itting, which he may doe kneeling.</hi> By which very PhraÅ¿e, all men may Å¿ee that theÅ¿e men take upon them to coyne a <hi>new divinitie:</hi> for I have read of <hi>materiall</hi> and <hi>formall Idolatry;</hi> But I dare
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:14382:94"/>Å¿ay that the diÅ¿tinction of <hi>Corporall</hi> and <hi>Spirituall Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try</hi> was never heard of, (at leaÅ¿t in this Å¿enÅ¿e) till theÅ¿e <hi>Empyrickes</hi> did invent it. But I will pardon him his i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnorance, as I have done many greater offences: for I find by another place in the Libell, what miÅ¿leades him: He Å¿ayes <hi>There is an outward worÅ¿hip as well as an inward,</hi> And therfor he thinkes there Å¿hould be an outward, or (as he termes it) <hi>Bodily Idolatry.</hi> But he is not Å¿o lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned as to know the difference betweene <gap reason="foreign">

I. That there is nothing in this world which is not (to uÅ¿e his own: PhraÅ¿e) <hi>Idolizable,</hi> even a mans
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:14382:95"/>owne bed: The ApoÅ¿tle Å¿peaking of <hi>Epieures,</hi> Å¿ayes <hi>Their belly is their God:</hi> So it may be Å¿aid of Å¿ome voluptuous men who glut themÅ¿elves with eaÅ¿e, Å¿leepe, and fleÅ¿hly pleaÅ¿ure; <hi>Their bed is their God.</hi> II. There was a time when the Sacrament had never beene abuÅ¿ed to Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, namely before theÅ¿e 800. yeares he Å¿peakes of, and if it was lawfull then to kneele in receiving, it is Å¿till law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full unto us; for I have proved at large that the abuÅ¿e of kneeling by others, makes not that geÅ¿ture uncleane un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us, the Å¿ame being a naturall geÅ¿ture which <hi>God</hi> hath Å¿anctified for his owne worÅ¿hip. I will goe further and juÅ¿tifie that if a man were caÅ¿t into <hi>Groanland,</hi> where for diverÅ¿e months he wanted the light of the Å¿unne, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards upon the firÅ¿t returne of the Å¿ame, it were not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull for him to fall downe upon his knees, &amp; praiÅ¿e <hi>God</hi> for the comfort of that light, albeit the Sunne of all other things hath beene made the greateÅ¿t Idol, and is the Å¿ame <hi>Individuall</hi> body which hath beene Å¿o abuÅ¿ed. III. If there be any force in that Argument or rather aÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ertion, it makes more Å¿trongly againÅ¿t the Sacrament it Å¿elfe, then againÅ¿t kneeling in <hi>Gods</hi> worÅ¿hip: for it was the bread which was made the Idol, and not kneeling, which being a naturall geÅ¿ture, alwayes was and ever will be common to true worÅ¿hippers and falÅ¿e.

But theÅ¿e two muÅ¿t be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tinguiÅ¿hed, The former never was, is, nor can be lawfull: But the latter namely, to worÅ¿hip <hi>God</hi> in his owne Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance, and Å¿o before a creature occaÅ¿ionally, is not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly lawfull, but Å¿ometimes neceÅ¿Å¿ary, as the former in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tances doe Å¿ufficiently declare. But here I know they will Å¿ay, They had a Å¿peciall warrant for what they did, which we have not. To let paÅ¿Å¿e what I have manifeÅ¿ted before in this diÅ¿courÅ¿e, that we have warrant both by precept and preÅ¿ident to kneele in any part of <hi>Gods</hi> worÅ¿hip, and conÅ¿equently in receiving of the bleÅ¿Å¿ed Sacrament: I will deÅ¿ire them firÅ¿t to conÅ¿ider, that if to worÅ¿hip before a creature, were all one as to transferre adoration unto it, (as they underÅ¿tand the matter) then no warrant could make it lawfull: it is Å¿o neceÅ¿Å¿arily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant unto the eternall Law, that <hi>God</hi> could not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand it: <hi>for God cannot deny himÅ¿elfe,</hi> and he Å¿ayeth:

III. That all geÅ¿tures have beene both abuÅ¿ed to Idolatry, and uÅ¿ed in the true Å¿ervice of <hi>God,</hi> though Å¿ome more, Å¿ome leÅ¿Å¿e, and indeed Å¿itting Å¿el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome or never but occaÅ¿ionally. IV. That one geÅ¿ture may be more decent and convenient then another, by reaÅ¿on of the nature of the Å¿ervice in hand, and of the occaÅ¿ion which may direct us unto it. V. That no ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ture was commanded in any Sacrament under the Law or under the GoÅ¿pell; nor made neceÅ¿Å¿ary in any of <hi>Gods</hi> Ordinances, either by precept or example. Whereupon followes. VI. That it is in the power of the <hi>Church,</hi> to appoint what geÅ¿ture Å¿hall be uÅ¿ed in the Sacrament, or in any other Ordinance: And our <hi>Church</hi> following the example of the Primitive <hi>Church</hi> hath appointed knee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling. VII. That it belongs not to any private man to judge what geÅ¿ture is decent, what not, But unto the Governors of the <hi>Church,</hi> who are not bound to give an account unto their inferiours of the reaÅ¿on of their conÅ¿titutions, made of things in themÅ¿elves indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent: yea, though they offe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Now let us take all theÅ¿e conÅ¿iderations together, That in the Sacrament are the Å¿ignes of <hi>Gods</hi> preÅ¿ence; That therin we worÅ¿hip <hi>God;</hi> offer our Å¿ervice, yea our Å¿elves unto him, receive won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull benefites from him, confeÅ¿Å¿e our Å¿innes with poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent hearts, pray unto <hi>God</hi> for his grace, and praiÅ¿e him for his wonderfull mercies: And it will appeare that hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility Å¿hould be the maine affection of our Å¿oules; It is Immility that praepares us to come to the Lords Table, And humility muÅ¿t preÅ¿ent us at his table: <hi>Humility</hi> is required in all ChriÅ¿tian actions, but eÅ¿pecially in recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the holy Sacrament, for at the InÅ¿titution of that Sacrament, <hi>ChriÅ¿t</hi> gave unto his diÅ¿ciples a leÅ¿Å¿on of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, by waÅ¿hing their feete: And were it not Å¿trange, If he would have us to expreÅ¿Å¿e humility one towards another in the Sacrament, and not alÅ¿o towards himÅ¿elfe, conÅ¿idering that he is repreÅ¿ented unto us in this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament as crucified for us? And if ther Å¿hould be humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the Å¿oule, why not alÅ¿o humiliation of the body?</p>
            <p>Here I have alleadged many motives, the leaÅ¿t wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of were Å¿ufficient to perÅ¿wade us to kneele, though we were at our owne choyce what geÅ¿ture to uÅ¿e in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving of the Sacrament. But as the caÅ¿e Å¿tands, ther is a neceÅ¿Å¿ity of kneeling, if we will receive the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; for the <hi>Church</hi> will not miniÅ¿ter the Å¿ame unto thoÅ¿e who contumaciouÅ¿ly deÅ¿piÅ¿e her wholÅ¿ome Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. And how can it Å¿tand with the peace of a mans conÅ¿cience, to Å¿pend and end his dayes without the
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:14382:104"/>comfort of the Sacrament? Shall this be a good plea be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Tribunal of <hi>ChriÅ¿t</hi> at that great day; <hi>Lord I did not ease at thy Å¿upper, becauÅ¿e I could not be permitted to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it as I doe my ordinary meales?</hi> Will not <hi>ChriÅ¿t</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿wer them as <hi>Samnel</hi> to <hi>Saul,</hi> Hath the Lord Å¿o great delight in civill faÅ¿hions or geÅ¿tures, as in <hi>obeying the voyce and ordinance of the Lord?</hi> We are commanded to eate and to drinke, but ther is no Commandement for any geÅ¿ture; And will any man loÅ¿e the Å¿ubÅ¿tance for the Ceremony? If he doe, not only <hi>Gideons</hi> Å¿ouldiers, but even <hi>Abrahams camels</hi> Å¿hall condemne him,
<note place="margin">Gen. 24.11.</note> who <hi>kneeled downe for to drinke water:</hi> And in the Sacrament is the water of life, which Å¿ome will rather never drinke, then bow for it. I beÅ¿eech them to conÅ¿ider how to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿turbance of the <hi>Churches</hi> peace, and great prejudice of their owne Å¿oule, they conteÅ¿t about <hi>trifles.</hi> Ther are other things wherein they may exerciÅ¿e their zeale. <hi>Contending for the faith which was once given unto the Å¿aints, Å¿triving to enter in at the strait gate,</hi> to goe one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore another in goodneÅ¿Å¿e, fighting againÅ¿t the <hi>luÅ¿ts which warre in their members,</hi> beating downe the pride of their owne hearts, and wreÅ¿tling <hi>againÅ¿t principalities and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.</hi> This were a Å¿trife worthy of a ChriÅ¿tian: But as for Ceremony or no Ceremony, kneeling or Å¿itting, a white garment or a black; <hi>The kingdome of God</hi> conÅ¿iÅ¿ts not in theÅ¿e things,
